With family in the valley, Jaclyn enjoyed many family reunions and Thanksgiving holidays here; even getting married at Caesars Palace.\n\nJaclyn started her broadcasting career at KOVR in Sacramento as a writer and producer, then made her way to the southeast region. As a reporter for WAGA in Atlanta for six years, she pounded the pavement covering crime and investigating community issues that affected local viewers.  As a field reporter, big stories took her around the country to cover scenes like the tornado-ravaged fields of Oklahoma, wildfires in Arizona and snowstorms in Illinois.\n\nJaclyn credits many mentors for motivating her in the field of journalism and she hopes to return the favor as an active member of the Asian American Journalism Association.\n\nIn her spare time, Jaclyn enjoys exploring new and different restaurants, art galleries and live music. She also has a soft spot for animals and confesses, “I feel like I say ‘hi’ to every dog I meet.” So, feel free to ask for a pet selfie!

Norman and his wife, Nancy, moved to Arizona in the summer of 1981.","longBio":"Royal Norman and his wife, Nancy, moved to Arizona in the summer of 1981.\n\nAs they drove into town that hot August afternoon, they were met by a huge dust storm. \"It's going to rain,\" they said to each other as the sky darkened. It did not. Thus, they were introduced to Arizona weather.\n\nRoyal graduated from Arizona State University in 1984 with a degree in meteorology-climatology. That summer, he started at 3TV as the weekend meteorologist, earning his American Meteorological Society Seal of Approval for both television and radio broadcasting.\n\nDuring his first 12 years at 3TV, Royal covered a tornado live from the station helicopter, was on the air as the under-construction Mill Avenue Bridge collapsed into the roaring flood waters of the Salt River, covered the eruption of Mount Kilauea in Hawaii, attended 50th-anniversary services at the USS Arizona Memorial in 1991 and was on the original crew of Good Morning Arizona.\n\nIn 1996, Royal and his family moved to Atlanta, where he was the Chief Meteorologist at WXIA-TV. His favorite part of living near the east coast was chasing hurricanes - something that never happens in Arizona.\n\nReturning to 3TV in 2001, Royal is now Arizona Family’s Chief Meteorologist. He works week nights and is a regular at 5 p.m., 8 p.m. and 9 p.m. During each holiday season, you can find Royal at a Christmas Angel tree near you urging everyone to “earn their wings.” \n\nHe was inducted into the Southwest Rocky Mountain NATAS Silver Circle in 2010 and in 2017, was honored with the Distinguished Alumnus Award from the Arizona State University College of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning. Royal has received 7 Emmys for weather reporting.","slug":"","instagram":"royalnorman","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"kpho","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"weather","last_updated_date":"2023-06-10T04:32:54.269Z","location":"Arizona's

During her time there, she covered back-to-back earthquakes that rocked the small town of Ridgecrest. Emma’s coverage highlighted heartbreaking stories of loss and people coming together to rebuild.\n\nThat same year, Emma reported on a high school mass shooting and uncovered disturbing details about a teen who sadly killed two of his classmates and injured three others.\n\nShe started her career as an intern for CNN in Atlanta, where she wrote, edited and helped field produce for the Special Projects department.\nEmma is thrilled to be back in Phoenix, telling stories and doing what she loves.\n\nWhen she isn’t reporting, she enjoys traveling, live music, yoga and sharing a good meal with

Norman and his wife, Nancy, moved to Arizona in the summer of 1981.","longBio":"Royal Norman and his wife, Nancy, moved to Arizona in the summer of 1981.\n\nAs they drove into town that hot August afternoon, they were met by a huge dust storm. \"It's going to rain,\" they said to each other as the sky darkened. It did not. Thus, they were introduced to Arizona weather.\n\nRoyal graduated from Arizona State University in 1984 with a degree in meteorology-climatology. That summer, he started at 3TV as the weekend meteorologist, earning his American Meteorological Society Seal of Approval for both television and radio broadcasting.\n\nDuring his first 12 years at 3TV, Royal covered a tornado live from the station helicopter, was on the air as the under-construction Mill Avenue Bridge collapsed into the roaring flood waters of the Salt River, covered the eruption of Mount Kilauea in Hawaii, attended 50th-anniversary services at the USS Arizona Memorial in 1991 and was on the original crew of Good Morning Arizona.\n\nIn 1996, Royal and his family moved to Atlanta, where he was the Chief Meteorologist at WXIA-TV. His favorite part of living near the east coast was chasing hurricanes - something that never happens in Arizona.\n\nReturning to 3TV in 2001, Royal is now Arizona Family’s Chief Meteorologist. He works week nights and is a regular at 5 p.m., 8 p.m. and 9 p.m. During each holiday season, you can find Royal at a Christmas Angel tree near you urging everyone to “earn their wings.” \n\nHe was inducted into the Southwest Rocky Mountain NATAS Silver Circle in 2010 and in 2017, was honored with the Distinguished Alumnus Award from the Arizona State University College of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning. Royal has received 7 Emmys for weather

She joined Arizona’s Family in January 2020.  ​\n\nBefore making a cross-country move to Arizona, Susan held the same title at WPRI in Providence, Rhode Island, recovering hundreds of thousands of dollars for consumers. During her time in the Ocean State, she also covered several high-profile stories for the station, including the Aaron Hernandez murder trial and the capture of Boston Bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Her series of reports on the failed launch of Rhode Island’s $364 million benefits eligibility computer system prompted special legislative hearings and led to the resignations of several senior administrators.\n\nSusan landed her first job in television news as a reporter and producer at WKTV in Utica, New York. She also worked at WFMJ in Youngstown, Ohio.  \n\nSusan graduated cum laude from Syracuse University with bachelor’s degrees in broadcast journalism, political science and Spanish. As part of her undergraduate studies, she spent a semester abroad in Madrid, Spain.\n\nSusan and her husband, Steve, have two children. Whenever they have a free moment together, they enjoy playing golf at the Valley’s beautiful courses.

seen telling the stories of everyday Arizonans on the 4, 5 and 6 p.m. newscasts. Sarah comes to the Valley from Charlottesville, Virginia, where she worked at CBS19 News as a weekend anchor and reporter.\n\nDuring her time there, Sarah scored many high-profile interviews. She earned an exclusive with former Vice-President Mike Pence, and traveled up and down the state's gubernatorial campaign trail speaking to Terry McAuliffe and Glenn Youngkin, as well as both Virginia senators, Mark Warner and Tim Kaine. She also made a guest appearance on CBSN as a “local matters” correspondent.\n\nDuring the pandemic, Sarah became passionate about highlighting good news and encouraging people to get involved in their community. After all, we each have the power to make great things happen and make the world a better place. At CBS19, Sarah hosted the “Feel Good Friday” franchise segment each week where she got to highlight someone in Charlottesville making a positive difference. She also traveled to schools in the greater Charlottesville area and brought that message to thousands of students.\n\nShe also shared her social impact and volunteer work at Miss Virginia, where she placed 1st runner-up in 2021 and earned more than $10,000 in scholarships.\n\nSarah holds a Bachelor of Arts in Theatre from James Madison University and is a recipient of the Helene Cecile Gallagher Scholarship, which helped her study abroad in London. While studying, Sarah landed roles in eight plays and three short films. She was also a member of JMU’s Weird Cousins Comedy Improv Group. In college, Sarah spent her summers as a professional emcee for National American Miss and traveled the company hosting numerous live shows.\n\nSarah’s favorite part of the job is meeting many new people and telling stories that have the power to make a difference.  When she’s not reporting in the field, you can find her in the gym, hiking, or trying new restaurants. If you see her out and about, don’t hesitate to say

A true hometown girl whose family’s roots are deep-seated in the Valley of the Sun, Jaime envisioned a career in journalism from the time she was a little girl. Since then, she has been passionately pursuing her dreams. \n\nJaime is a successful product of the Scottsdale Unified School District, including attending Chaparral High School. After graduating from Arizona State University’s Walter Cronkite School of Broadcast Journalism, she went on to build her professional resume with her first TV job as a one-man-band reporter in Joplin, MO, before moving to Springfield, MO; Beaumont, TX; and Oklahoma City, OK. In 2013, she returned home to become part of Arizona’s Family. \n\nThe responsibility of her craft is one Jaime does not take lightly. She gets in the trenches for the sake of credible storytelling! She’s covered hurricanes, ice storms, blizzards, tornadoes — and even reported live from inside a massive monsoon dust storm for Arizona’s Family. That viral video is worth a Google. Jaime is proud to have won several Emmy Awards with her Arizona’s Family team for their coverage of monsoon storms, protests in Downtown Phoenix and the WM Phoenix Open\n\nDuring her six and a half years anchoring Good Morning Arizona weekends, she created her passion project — a weekly franchise dubbed “Jaime’s Local Love.” This program shines the spotlight on Arizona’s local business owners. She is greatly inspired by their perseverance, dedication and true love of their work. Jaime’s admiration of the entrepreneurial spirit stems from her own family — the Cerretas have been handmaking candy at the Cerreta Candy Company in Glendale for more than 50 years! \n\nJaime has worked evenings, weekends and mornings at Arizona’s Family and is currently on-air weekday evenings. She is honored to do the work she loves, in the city she loves, with the people she loves. \n\n“It’s a privilege to work in the community I grew up in,” she says. “I feel like one of the luckiest people in TV news. I truly love the people I work with and the people I serve.” \n\nWhen not behind the anchor desk or traversing the town uncovering the next hidden gem to highlight on “Jaime’s Local Love,” you can find Jaime checking out a new hot spot in town, supporting her sister and brother-in-law’s Loot N’ Booty BBQ team, hanging with her INCREDIBLE parents, or making waves at the nearest beach — preferably in San Diego or Rocky Point! \n\nIf you see Jaime out and about, be sure to say hi — she loves meeting her viewers. If you have a story idea or a “Jaime’s Local Love” suggestion, send her an email.

Thunderstorms\ntoday will produce strong and gusty thunderstorm outflow winds\ncapable of producing dense blowing dust this afternoon into this\nevening. Hazardous driving conditions due to a rapidly reduced\nvisibility in blowing dust is possible. These thunderstorm\noutflow winds will likely suspend dust into the air that people\nand animals breathe. Individuals with heart disease and\nrespiratory sensitivities may want to reduce their level of\nexertion to limit the dust they breathe into their\nlungs...especially if the are near dust-prone locations. Those\nmost at risk may feel better if they avoid outside exercise\ntoday...keeping windows and doors closed to help reduce\nexposure.\nPRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...\nMotorists should not drive into an area of blowing dust.\nRemember, Pull Aside, Stay Alive.\nKeep in mind you may need to adjust your plans based on the\nlatest health and safety guidelines from CDC and your local\nofficials. Cooling shelters may need to take your temperature or\nask questions about how you are feeling.\nDrink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out\nof the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors. Young\nchildren and pets should never be left unattended in vehicles\nunder any circumstances.\nTake extra precautions if you work or spend time outside. When\npossible reschedule strenuous activities to early morning or\nevening. Know the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat\nstroke. Wear lightweight and loose fitting clothing when\npossible.
