Many of the residents were bedridden.</p><p>"Yeah, we are risking our lives, but this is worth it," said Chris Russell, one of the volunteers.</p><p>It took five hours to rescue the residents and deliver them to area hospitals.</p><p>"I think what we were able to accomplish tonight, was to give these people some dignity, holding their hand, asking them if they would like to somebody to pray with them," said Allen Lenard, another volunteer.

      <p>Duke Energy says the collapse of a coal ash landfill at a closed power station near the North Carolina coast is an "ongoing situation," with an unknown amount of potentially contaminated stormwater flowing into a nearby lake.</p><p>Duke spokeswoman Paige Sheehan said Sunday that a full assessment of how much ash escaped at the Sutton Power Station outside Wilmington can't occur until it stops raining. She said there was no indication that contamination from Sutton Lake drained into the nearby Cape Fear River.</p>

<p>The company initially estimated on Saturday that about 2,000 cubic yards of ash were displaced at the landfill, which is enough to fill about 180 dump trucks. Sheehan said that estimate could be revised after a further examination of conditions at the site.</p><hr id="horizontalrule"></section><section class="content__body" data-use-autolinker="true" id="post-update5"><h2>NFL to donate $1 million to Florence relief efforts</h2>
