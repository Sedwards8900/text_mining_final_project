<h1><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, sans-serif;">Overview</span></h1>

<p><em><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">The Winter Outbreak that occurred on Valentine&#39;s Week 2021 brought not only snow, sleet, and freezing rain to Southeast Texas, but also extreme cold temperatures that lasted for several days. This was one of the most impactful winter events&nbsp;in recent history that brought multiday road closures, power outages, loss of heat, broken pipes, and other societal impacts for the region. While the damage is still being assessed, this will likely go down as the first <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/">billion dollar disaster</a> of 2021 globally, and potentially the most costly weather disaster for the state of Texas in history, surpassing even <a href="https://www.weather.gov/hgx/hurricaneharvey">Hurricane Harvey</a> from 2017.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong></em></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">It all began Wednesday, February 10th when a cold front moved through the area bringing the first surge of cold air into the region. With this cold air in place, lingering precipitation the following day fell as sleet and freezing rain across the northwestern counties. The first Winter Weather Advisory of this prolonged winter event was issued in the morning hours of Thursday, February 11th for Burleson, Brazos, and Madison counties as area roads began to become hazardous from the icy precipitation. This Advisory would end up getting expanded to include Washington and&nbsp;Grimes counties after sunset that evening and continued through Friday morning due to lingering precipitation. While this first taste of winter precipitation was impacting the region, a stronger Arctic cold front was progressing through the country and&nbsp;was expected to reach Southeast Texas late Sunday. On Friday, February 12th, a Winter Storm Watch was issued for the entire region for Sunday in anticipation for the potential snow, sleet, and freezing rain that this Arctic front would bring. A Winter Storm Warning ended up getting issued on Saturday, February 13th for Colorado, Austin, Waller, Montgomery, San Jacinto, Polk counties and for counties north as sleet and freezing rain formed ahead of the approaching cold front.&nbsp;The counties that remained in the Winter Storm Watch (</span><span style="font-size: 18px;">Jackson, Wharton, Fort Bend, Harris, and Liberty counties and the other counties along the coast) got upgraded to a Warning for Sunday.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">As expected, the strong Arctic cold front passed through Southeast Texas on Sunday (Valentine&#39;s Day). It served as the turning point from a significant winter storm the preceded the front to the&nbsp;<em>historic </em>winter event that would eventually unfold.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="/images/hgx/events/ValentinesStorm_2021/WSW_Texas.PNG" style="width: 400px; height: 413px;" /></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">On Sunday, every square inch of Texas was in a Winter Storm Warning.&nbsp;Snow, sleet, and freezing rain began to encroach into Southeast Texas&nbsp;Sunday afternoon, and then&nbsp;increased in coverage and intensity overnight Sunday night into Monday. Thunder snow was reported near the town of Snook, Burleson County Sunday evening, and then thunder sleet occurred near the Brazoria and Galveston counties coastline Sunday night. Roads began to become impassable through the region Sunday evening due to ice and snow and some would not become safe until Friday. Temperatures crashed down Sunday night behind the cold front with much of the area getting down into the teens or single digits with wind chills down into the single digits or even below zero. Because of these conditions, a Hard Freeze Warning and a Wind Chill Warning (the first in our office&#39;s history) was in effect Sunday night/Monday morning. A combination of the icy conditions and extreme cold temperatures caused widespread power outages that would last for the next several days. The wintry precipitation continued through Monday morning with storm total snow/sleet accumulations being around trace along the coast, around an inch near the Houston Metro, and up to three to six inches up across the north. The extreme cold temperatures not just persisted through Tuesday morning, but dipped down even colder and produced&nbsp;the coldest morning of the event: the City of Houston went down to 13&deg;F, Galveston down to 20&deg;F, and College Station bottomed out at just 5&deg;F.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">Unfortunately, the week wasn&#39;t done yet. Another winter storm was anticipated to bring significant freezing rain&nbsp;along and north of Interstate-10 Tuesday night&nbsp;requiring an additional&nbsp;Winter Storm Warning. This new&nbsp;ice accumulation, combined with any refreezing of previous moisture, continued the hazardous road conditions Tuesday evening through the day on Wednesday. Conditions did not improve Wednesday night as lingering precipitation brought snow and sleet to the northern half of the region that lasted through midday Thursday. While the wintry precipitation wound down Thursday evening, the dangerously cold temperatures and hazardous road conditions continued. It wasn&#39;t until 9am Saturday morning that the last Hard Freeze Warning would expire for this event. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">There was a total of 8 days, 23 hours, and 23 minutes of winter highlights between the first Winter Weather Advisory issued on Thursday, February 11th at 9:37am to when the last Hard Freeze Warning expired at 9am on Saturday, February 20th.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;">The winter outbreak in February 2021 will be on the minds of every Texan for a very long time. </span></p>

<p>.LONG TERM [Sunday Through Friday]...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&hellip;An upper level trough will be moving into Southern California on</p>

<p>Wednesday, but how strong and how quickly it moves west will</p>

<p>determine how the end of the long term period pans out. The GFS is</p>

<p>the weakest and quickest solution bringing the trough across Texas</p>

<p>late Thursday into Friday increasing PoPs Thursday afternoon into</p>

<p>Thursday night, but then drying out through the weekend. The EC has</p>

<p>had the upper level trough stronger, becoming a closed low over the</p>

<p>Baja Peninsula by Thursday evening. This solution brings</p>

<p>precipitation beginning Thursday, but continues it into the weekend</p>

<p>as the stalled boundary stays parked near the area. The Canadian is</p>

<p>a bit in the middle of the road between the GFS and EC, with a</p>

<p>stronger trough moving across Texas on Friday. The real forecast</p>

<p>challenge Thursday night will be how cold it gets. Temperatures will</p>

<p>be flirting with near freezing across the northern tier of counties</p>

<p>bringing the potential for a wintry mixture to those areas. There</p>

<p>are still a lot of uncertainties in this forecast, so temperatures</p>

<p>may trend warmer or cooler through the next few days.</p>

<p>.LONG TERM [Sunday Night Through Saturday Night]...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Partly to occasionally mostly cloudy skies can be expected Sunday</p>

<p>night through Monday night as high pressure moves off to the</p>

<p>east. With this onshore flow, look for warmer temperatures to come</p>

<p>back to the area with inland highs back into the 70s on Monday.</p>

<p>The next cold front will slowly sag into the area on Tuesday and</p>

<p>will bring some cooler temperatures back to the region. This front</p>

<p>should linger somewhere near/along the coast until a stronger</p>

<p>front moves through on Thursday. With these fronts in the area and</p>

<p>mid/upper level disturbances moving across the area, expect</p>

<p>periods of rain in the Wednesday through Thursday night time</p>

<p>period. At this time, it looks like the coldest temperatures will</p>

<p>hold off until Thursday night as the area begins to dry out. Some</p>

<p>models/soundings indicate some support for possible frozen</p>

<p>precipitation for parts of the area on Thursday night before the</p>

<p>drying occurs, and we&#39;ll continue to watch how the models handle</p>

<p>this over the next several days. Stay tuned. We are currently</p>

<p>carrying a dry forecast Friday night through Saturday with lows in</p>

<p>the 20s/30s and highs in the 40s.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>.LONG TERM [Tuesday Through Saturday]...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We&#39;ll be starting the work week on a warm note...with things likely</p>

<p>ending very much colder by the end of the week (as indicated by the</p>

<p>previous forecast for the most part). High pressure well off to the</p>

<p>E/NE will allow for a persistent onshore flow across SE TX Mon/Tues</p>

<p>as low-level moisture levels slowly increase. A nearly zonal flow at</p>

<p>the upper levels are hinting that the cold front (originally slated</p>

<p>for Tues) could have some trouble making it that far south into our</p>

<p>CWA. As a result, will trend high temperatures Mon/Tues warmer with</p>

<p>lower/mid 70s for most inland areas...upper 60s at the coast.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rain chances are still set to return Weds as disturbances embedded</p>

<p>in the W/SW flow aloft begin moving across the state. This activity</p>

<p>could be enhanced by the lingering cold front, but at this time it</p>

<p>is hard to pinpoint where exactly. But going by these latest runs,</p>

<p>POPs may be best on Wed over our northern counties. These elevated</p>

<p>rain chances are expected to linger through Thurs with the passage</p>

<p>of the second stronger cold front. Have leaned more toward the GFS</p>

<p>and Canadian solutions with this part of the forecast as they have</p>

<p>been verifying a bit better of late. As such, we could be in store</p>

<p>for a couple nights of freezing to below freezing temperatures for</p>

<p>overnight lows for much of SE TX from Thur night into the weekend.</p>

<p>High temperatures for this period could range from the 40s and 50s</p>

<p>if these models do verify.&nbsp; 41</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>.LONG TERM [Monday Night through Sunday]...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Temperatures will be on the mild to warm side for a large part of</p>

<p>the area until the arrival and passage of the next cold front</p>

<p>late Wednesday night or Thursday. Highs in the 60s/70s on Tuesday</p>

<p>and Wednesday will cool down behind the front with 50/60s on</p>

<p>Thursday and 40s/50s Friday through Sunday in response to strong</p>

<p>high pressure slowly building into the area from the northwest and</p>

<p>north. There are still some differences in the models (frontal</p>

<p>location/ timing and how cold the airmass gets as the high builds</p>

<p>in) that will have to be closely monitored over the next several</p>

<p>days and could bring some changes to the forecast (including the</p>

<p>possibility of colder temperatures). At this time, the coldest</p>

<p>nights look to be setting up for Friday night and Saturday night</p>

<p>with lows in the 20s/30s.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for rain, will be keeping the forecast dry until Wednesday</p>

<p>when enough moisture and lift return to the area and begin to</p>

<p>interact with disturbances moving across the state. Rain chances</p>

<p>look to remain in the forecast (highest generally to the north of</p>

<p>I-10 and to the east of I-45) until Thursday afternoon and evening</p>

<p>when the front moves on through and dries the area out. At this</p>

<p>time, the coldest air does not arrive until all the rain has moved</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A persistent onshore flow Tue and Weds will be keeping temperatures</p>

<p>on the mild/warm side for a much of SE TX. While the zonal pattern</p>

<p>aloft will be helping to keep the cold front just north of the CWA</p>

<p>on Tue, there are some hints that the passage of a few upper level</p>

<p>disturbances (via the southern stream jet) could nudge this bound-</p>

<p>ary a bit into our northern zones very briefly late Tues afternoon.</p>

<p>But that being said, will err on the side of warm and keep daytime</p>

<p>highs mostly in the 70s for inland locations both Tue/Weds at this</p>

<p>time. Lows are expected to range from the 50s inland to near 60 at</p>

<p>the immediate coast.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rain chances will also begin increasing Weds given this heating as</p>

<p>well PWs climbing to 1.3-1.4&quot; and progs of a decent low-level jet.</p>

<p>These elevated POPs are expected to continue into Weds night/Thurs</p>

<p>with the arrival/passage of the cold front across SE TX. Even with</p>

<p>global models remaining sharply divided with regard to how cold we</p>

<p>will get, FROPA timing is trending a little better. That is, we&#39;ll</p>

<p>be looking for the wind shift to reach the coast Thur afternoon or</p>

<p>evening per these latest runs. Did include the mention of isolated</p>

<p>thunder in the grids for this time period given the progged sound-</p>

<p>ings of some decent CAPE. As the very cold air mass moves into the</p>

<p>region behind this front, a much colder forecast is on tap through</p>

<p>the rest of the week. Daytime highs Fri/Sat could struggle to make</p>

<p>it into the mid/upper 50s (..and possibly into Sun). We could also</p>

<p>see our coldest temperatures of the season for both Fri and/or Sat</p>

<p>nights. Currently going with overnight low temperatures in the mid</p>

<p>to upper 20s over the northern third of our CWA...at/around freez-</p>

<p>ing for central locations...upper 30s for the coastal counties for</p>

<p>this time period.&nbsp; 41</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>.LONG TERM [Tuesday Night through Monday]...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A persistent onshore flow on Tuesday and Wednesday will help to</p>

<p>keep temperatures on the warm side for much of Southeast Texas. It</p>

<p>still appears possible that a cold front that is expected to</p>

<p>remain just to the north of our area could be nudged just a little</p>

<p>southward on Tuesday or Tuesday night resulting in a slight</p>

<p>cooldown behind the boundary for locations way up north. In</p>

<p>general, expect much of the inland areas to see highs in the 70s</p>

<p>for both Tuesday and Wednesday. Some fog (mainly in the late night</p>

<p>through early morning hours) could develop, especially in/around</p>

<p>the Galveston Bay area and near the beaches. Rain chances return</p>

<p>to the forecast Wednesday afternoon and persist until the next</p>

<p>cold front moves through the area on Thursday.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hope you enjoyed the warmer early February temperatures because</p>

<p>everything changes with the passage of Thursday&#39;s front as a</p>

<p>colder airmass filters into the area. Locations up north should</p>

<p>cool down Wednesday night, and the rest of the area will see</p>

<p>falling temperatures during the day on Thursday after the boundary</p>

<p>moves on through. Rains chances will decrease and eventually come</p>

<p>to an end from west to east starting late Thursday afternoon or</p>

<p>early Thursday evening and continuing through Thursday night. Low</p>

<p>temperatures Friday morning are expected to range from the mid to</p>

<p>upper 30s inland to the mid to upper 40s at the coast. Strong high</p>

<p>pressure at the surface will begin building into the area from</p>

<p>the north, and cold air advection is anticipated to help to keep</p>

<p>high temperatures in the 40s/50s on Friday. Lows in the 30s/40s</p>

<p>and highs in the 40s/50s look to persist throughout the weekend</p>

<p>and on into the start of next week as the area remains under the</p>

<p>influence of the surface high. In addition to the colder</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rain chances will be increasing on Weds...with the best POPs across</p>

<p>our N/NE CWA. The combination of a stalled cold front (likely close</p>

<p>to our northern borders) and a developing low/mid level jet as well</p>

<p>abundant daytime heating/low-level moisture (PWs from 1.2&quot; to 1.4&quot;)</p>

<p>should support the development of scattered showers/isolated thund-</p>

<p>erstorms by Weds afternoon. As all/most of these features remain in</p>

<p>place, elevated POPs will likely persist into Weds night and Thurs.</p>

<p>However, the main WX story for Thurs will be the arrival/passage of</p>

<p>the strong cold front and the cold arctic air mass filtering down in</p>

<p>to the region in its wake. Did keep the mention of isolated TSRA in</p>

<p>for FROPA with most of this activity likely elevated. Rains will be</p>

<p>ending with the front from west to east by late Thurs afternoon/eve</p>

<p>and continuing through Thurs night.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As it has been hinted at previously, the main forecast issues going</p>

<p>forward will be related to the very cold air mass that&#39;s progged to</p>

<p>settle over the region by the end of the week and into the weekend.</p>

<p>Low temperatures Fri morning should range from the mid to upper 30s</p>

<p>inland to the mid to upper 40s along the coast. Strong surface high</p>

<p>pressure building into the state from the north and persistent cold</p>

<p>air advection will help to keep high temperatures in the 40s/50s on</p>

<p>Fri. Temperatures could fall even lower for Sat/Sun by another 5 to</p>

<p>10 degrees for both highs and lows. As such, we could be looking at</p>

<p>a few nights of prolonged freezing or below freezing temperatures.</p>

<p>In addition to these colder temperatures, shortwaves moving across</p>

<p>the area from the SW will have the potential produce some low POPs</p>

<p>Sat/Sun/Mon. And yes, while there are hints that we could see some</p>

<p>frozen/wintry precipitation (per GFS extended runs), confidence not</p>

<p>high enough to include its mention in the grids at this time. 41</p>

<p>.LONG TERM [Thursday through Monday Night]...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The main concern in the extended is the potential for well below</p>

<p>normal temperatures late this week into next week.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Showers and a few thunderstorms will be ongoing on Thursday as a</p>

<p>mid- upper level trough deepens over western TX and a cold front</p>

<p>slowly moves through during the morning hours. While colder air</p>

<p>begins to filter in by late Wed night, warm air aloft (roughly at</p>

<p>850 mb) should aid to keep rain chances through Thursday night. In</p>

<p>fact, by late morning and afternoon the frontal band becomes more</p>

<p>organized with elevated instability and decent mid-level</p>

<p>frontogenesis persisting along the front. This should aid in</p>

<p>enhancing rainfall rates; therefore, have PoPs likely through at</p>

<p>least, late Thursday night. Rainfall totals are still uncertain,</p>

<p>but 1-1.5 inch amounts cannot be ruled out.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>After this front...the fun part begins. The first piece of Arctic</p>

<p>airmass breaks off and settles across the Plains in the wake of</p>

<p>the front. This dry and cold airmass will take highs back down</p>

<p>into the upper 40s to upper 50s by Friday. Even more chilly or</p>

<p>frigid conditions filter in as the main 1044 mb Arctic high over</p>

<p>the Canadian Plains shifts east-southeast across the High Plains.</p>

<p>Our confidence is moderate to high that cold conditions will</p>

<p>arrive to southeast TX; however, there is still uncertainty on the</p>

<p>amount of cold air filtering in. We are still seeing quite a</p>

<p>spread between models with GFS being one of the coldest solutions.</p>

<p>Latest NBM guidance also suggest a very cold weekend with MaxT in</p>

<p>the 30s to low 40s Sunday and from the upper 20 to mid 30s</p>

<p>Monday. Given that, have leaned towards the colder solutions for</p>

<p>temperatures Saturday into Monday and went fairly close to the</p>

<p>25th percentile of climatology. As for now, get ready for a cold</p>

<p>weekend for southeast Texas standards. How cold will it get?</p>

<p>That&#39;s the main question, but even if warmer solutions verify it</p>

<p>could still be cold enough at most locations. The main takeaway is</p>

<p>to keep up with the latest forecasts and be prepared to take</p>

<p>action to protect people, vegetation and property (pipes). On the</p>

<p>other hand, confidence on breezy conditions is also increasing</p>

<p>Friday into the weekend, which will help to keep wind chill values</p>

<p>even colder.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Precipitation-wise, a few shortwaves embedded in the</p>

<p>southwesterly flow aloft will move through the region Saturday and</p>

<p>Sunday, therefore, hinting at some precipitation chances. Better</p>

<p>chances look to arrive towards the end of the period as a coastal</p>

<p>low develops and lifts northward into the region Monday into</p>

<p>Tuesday. There could be some light mixed precipitation over parts</p>

<p>of the forecast area with mainly snow-rain mix to our north.</p>

<p>Confidence is very low on this right now as there are a lot of</p>

<p>details to still be worked out. Overall, keep in mind that we are</p>

<p>still 4 to 7 days out so this forecast will change during the week.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fairly high rain chances will be ongoing across SE TX on Thurs with</p>

<p>the passage of the strong cold front. The bulk of the precipitation</p>

<p>should be showers, but still cannot rule out isolated thunderstorms</p>

<p>given the modest lapse rates/weak instability. All this activity is</p>

<p>expected to move off the coast with the front by early Fri morning.</p>

<p>Rainfall totals should average from 1/2 to 1 inch over the CWA with</p>

<p>isolated higher amounts from 1 to 1.5 inches possible.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Otherwise, the main forecast issue with this portion of the forecast</p>

<p>looks to be the potential for some very cold/well below normal temp-</p>

<p>eratures for an extended period (Thurs night through Mon night), and</p>

<p>perhaps a slight chance of precipitation during the same time frame.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Progs of a series of strong surface highs moving down from the High</p>

<p>Plains (1041mb to 1047mb) into the Central Plains from Thurs on in-</p>

<p>to the weekend&nbsp; will help maintain a strong/persistent CAA into the</p>

<p>state. Will continue to lean on the side of the colder GFS/Canadian</p>

<p>solutions for our temperatures. This pattern could produce extended</p>

<p>periods of freezing/below freezing temperatures this weekend...with</p>

<p>possibly a Freeze Warning for our coastal counties. Slightly better</p>

<p>consensus/slowly increasing confidence with the likelihood of colder</p>

<p>weather does make this a very good time to remind everyone to check</p>

<p>their cold weather preparations (both inside and outside) for this</p>

<p>potentially prolonged cold snap.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for the chances of precipitation...models are continuing to show</p>

<p>a series of embedded shortwaves moving across the area through this</p>

<p>weekend. As it usually is with the SW flow aloft, the timing of said</p>

<p>shortwaves is expected to be an issue. Given the very cold air mass</p>

<p>in place over SE TX...there could be some light mixed precipitation</p>

<p>(rain-snow/sleet mix) over the CWA at times during this time frame.</p>

<p>As all of this is still a ways away, confidence remains very low for</p>

<p>this even verifying at this time. 41</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>.SHORT TERM [Through Thursday Night]...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At 4am, a shallow cold front was situated from roughly Edna-Wharton-</p>

<p>Houston-Cleveland. It should remain in that general vicinity for</p>

<p>most of the day. Some guidance drifts it north a touch, others</p>

<p>(primarily the hires guidance that was heavily weighted) sags it a</p>

<p>bit further south. South of the boundary, dense sea fog has rolled</p>

<p>back in. Visibilities will again improve inland during the mid-late</p>

<p>morning hours, but not so much along the beaches and offshore.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Moist southerly flow just above the sfc will be transporting an axis</p>

<p>of higher PW&#39;s into the region. Expect some sct pockets of -ra to</p>

<p>begin developing this morning near the boundary...eventually</p>

<p>increasing in coverage and becoming more showery further to the</p>

<p>north during the day. Can&#39;t completely rule out an iso tstm, but</p>

<p>it&#39;ll be the exception rather than the rule.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Somewhat of a break in precip is anticipated for most areas late in</p>

<p>the day, but anticipate some additional sct development across the</p>

<p>area later this evening...mainly near and just to the north of the</p>

<p>frontal boundary as it begins a southward push toward and off the</p>

<p>coast.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Heading into to Thurs, western trof will be making ewd progress</p>

<p>closer to the area. We should still have some respectable PW&#39;s in</p>

<p>the 1.2-1.5&quot; range in place the region. Increasing large scale lift</p>

<p>(and a series of impulses embedded in the swly flow aloft and</p>

<p>favorable jet position) should allow precip to increase in areal</p>

<p>coverage thru the day Thurs and Thurs night. May see some elevated</p>

<p>tstms mixed in...and also some periods of training moderate rains at</p>

<p>times Thurs night. In general, 0.75-1.75&quot; of rain can be expected in</p>

<p>the Thur-Thurs night time period. Grounds should be able to handle</p>

<p>this without much of an issue considering it&#39;ll be spread out over a</p>

<p>fairly long duration, but always need to keep an eye on the rain</p>

<p>rates for any very localized issues that may crop up in association</p>

<p>with any training.&nbsp; 47</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>.LONG TERM [Friday through Tuesday Night]...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cold to frigid conditions along with a chance for mixed</p>

<p>precipitation are the main story in the long term forecast.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other than perhaps some lingering showers across our far</p>

<p>east/coastal zones Friday morning, the day should be relatively</p>

<p>dry. At the surface, CAA continues to filter in drier and colder</p>

<p>air, leading to daytime temperatures from the mid 40s to mid 50s.</p>

<p>This is 10 to 20 degrees below normal/average. Overnight lows will</p>

<p>range in the 30s and low 40s. By Saturday morning, the next</p>

<p>shortwave embedded within the southwesterly flow will allow for</p>

<p>increasing lifting and saturation along the BL, especially across</p>

<p>our western counties. Forcing, on the the hand, diminishes/weakens</p>

<p>as the shortwave moves east/southeast. Therefore, have only light</p>

<p>precipitation chances.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The scenario turns a bit more interesting as we head into Sunday</p>

<p>and early next week. The synoptic pattern aloft will be dominated</p>

<p>by a shortwave trough across central/southeast TX, a Canadian low</p>

<p>wobbling between the Great Lakes and the International Border,</p>

<p>and a low developing over the Pacific Northwest. The evolution of</p>

<p>this upper low is the one we should continue to monitor over the</p>

<p>coming days. This upper low will quickly progress across the</p>

<p>southern Rockies/central TX by Sunday, moving across the forecast</p>

<p>area on Monday. The environment will be favorable for widespread</p>

<p>precipitation as the region will be situated in a favorable</p>

<p>region of the upper level jet, with increasing PVA and decent</p>

<p>southerly LLJ. Will continue to monitor this system as models also</p>

<p>hint for some mid-level frontogenesis; however, the layer above</p>

<p>still remains more stable. With that being said, an unsettled</p>

<p>start to the week is likely. The main question will be p-types.</p>

<p>Latest guidance indicates that surface temperatures will likely</p>

<p>drop to near freezing across our northern/western counties,</p>

<p>bringing a wintry mix and/or freezing rain throughout the day.</p>

<p>Precipitation should quickly taper off by Monday night as a</p>

<p>strong surface high builds in. Well, to make matters worse, breezy</p>

<p>northwesterly winds will be possible, causing wind chill values in</p>

<p>the teens and 20s possible.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Speaking of cold....Significantly cold conditions are expected</p>

<p>this weekend into next week, with record breaking cold forecast.</p>

<p>The strong and amplified Arctic high will dive southward across</p>

<p>the Plains and into our region. While confidence is increasing,</p>

<p>there is still uncertainty on how cold southeast TX will get.</p>

<p>Continued with a cold forecast and went close to the mean and/or</p>

<p>coldest solutions from Day 4 - 7. Even chilly or frigid conditions</p>

<p>will be possible Monday night into Tuesday. Have leaned towards</p>

<p>raw deterministic and ConsALL for lows during this time-frame to</p>

<p>produce temperatures in the teens and 20s.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Key Messages:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1) Big changes on the way! A prolonged stretch of cold and winter</p>

<p>weather will be possible late this week into next week with</p>

<p>temperatures well below average for this time of year.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2) Precipitation chances increase late Sunday into early next</p>

<p>week with a potential for a wintry mix. Confidence is moderate in</p>

<p>terms of a wet/unsettled pattern during this period; however,</p>

<p>uncertainty arises on the type of precipitation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>3) A prolonged period of very cold conditions will be possible.</p>

<p>Be prepared to take action and protect people, plants, and</p>

<p>properties (pipes). We encourage you to monitor the forecast over</p>

<p>the next days for the latest information and/or possible</p>

<p>.LONG TERM [Friday through Wednesday]...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rain chances will be decreasing Fri morning through the afternoon</p>

<p>as the cold front pushes well into the Gulf. Strong high pressure</p>

<p>building down from the Plains will help to usher in a very arctic</p>

<p>air mass into the region at this time with frigid conditions exp-</p>

<p>ected to persist through the weekend and and at least through the</p>

<p>first half of next week. The other part of the story for the long</p>

<p>term portion of the forecast will be the increasing likelihood of</p>

<p>wintry precipitation mixed into all of this..lower chances on Sat</p>

<p>and perhaps higher chances Sun night/Mon.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Global models are continuing to trend cold for the weekend...then</p>

<p>even colder during the early part of next week as the strong/amp-</p>

<p>lified Arctic surface high is progged to track south in the Great</p>

<p>Plains. Did not go quite as low as some of the MOS has suggested,</p>

<p>but record lows will be entirely possible.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for rain chances, models appear to be in decent agreement with</p>

<p>the timing/strength of these systems. The first shortwave appears</p>

<p>to move through SE TX on Sat, but with not so favorable low-level</p>

<p>moisture levels and upper support. Did include the mention of ice</p>

<p>pellets/sleet and freezing rain for mainly the far northern parts</p>

<p>of the FA for Sat morning/afternoon. Otherwise, will be expecting</p>

<p>isolated to scattered cold rains. However, things seem to be more</p>

<p>favorable for increased POPs for Sun night/Mon. The possible dev-</p>

<p>elopment of a coastal low and divergent jet structure aloft along</p>

<p>with the strong shortwave are all pointing to much better chances</p>

<p>for precipitation. The main question then becomes p-types. Latest</p>

<p>guidance indicates that surface temperatures will likely drop to/</p>

<p>near freezing across our northern/western CWA by midnight Sun, so</p>

<p>we&#39;ll be starting off with freezing rain/wintry mix overnight. As&nbsp;</p>

<p>temperatures continue to fall early Mon, this could transition to</p>

<p>more of a snow/wintry mix through Mon morning. And so...the morn-</p>

<p>ing commute on Mon could be a very tricky one.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Looking even further ahead...guidance not really offering up much</p>

<p>by way of warming and/or drying. There are hints of another round</p>

<p>of rain/wintry mix for SE TX with the passage of yet another very</p>

<p>strong cold front and its associated shortwave. *whew* 41</p>

<p>**If traveling across northern parts of the Brazos Valley today</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Enhanced lift in association of upper trof over northern Mexico,</p>

<p>upper disturbances in the swly flow aloft and a moist srly flow</p>

<p>over the cold airmass at the sfc will aid in increasing precip</p>

<p>development today and tonight. There&#39;s some instability aloft so</p>

<p>there will probably be some elevated tstms mixed in as well. Best</p>

<p>lift should be realized across the northern half of the CWA</p>

<p>between now and early evening closer the RRQ of upper jet and</p>

<p>convergent zone near H85. We will be closely monitoring temps in</p>

<p>the Brazos Valley today. Currently they&#39;re in the 33-36F range and</p>

<p>doubt they&#39;ll see much if any of a warm-up. Some guidance drops</p>

<p>the temps another few degrees. Should this occur, can&#39;t rule out</p>

<p>some patches of ice on elevated bridges and surfaces. Think best</p>

<p>chances of this occurring will be just n/nw of our CWA, but too</p>

<p>close for comfort. Depending on trends, the dayshift may need to</p>

<p>evaluate the need for a winter wx advisory. Precip should mostly</p>

<p>taper off there early in the evening as it heads toward the</p>

<p>US59/I-69 corridor and eastward into the overnight hours. Bulk of</p>

<p>precip should end slightly after midnight, though fcst soundings</p>

<p>remain saturated in the llvls so would anticipate some areas of</p>

<p>drizzle continuing into Fri morning. Again...will need to keep a</p>

<p>close eye on this across the Brazos Valley as readings remain near</p>

<p>the freezing mark.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sct areas of -ra/dz will probably persist into Friday across</p>

<p>southern parts of the region closer to the coast with continued</p>

<p>isentropic lift. Otherwise, cloudy and continued cold heading into</p>

<p>the weekend and into next week when the fun really begins... 47</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>.LONG TERM [Saturday through Wednesday Night]...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The main focus in the long term continues to be a prolonged</p>

<p>period of well-below temperatures and multiple chances for mixed</p>

<p>precipitation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Arctic blast is on the way with the coldest readings expected</p>

<p>after Sunday. Latest forecast guidance keeps the strong surface</p>

<p>high building over west/central Canada through Saturday, shifting</p>

<p>southward into the Plains Sunday through much of next week.</p>

<p>Temperatures were adjusted a few degrees colder than NBM guidance</p>

<p>and went fairly close to the 10th-25th percentile through the</p>

<p>period.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are multiple rounds of precipitation during the period. The</p>

<p>first mid-upper level wave arrives Saturday into early Sunday.</p>

<p>While dynamics largely remain west and north of the area in terms</p>

<p>of legitimate precipitation, the system will drive a decent PV</p>

<p>anomaly enough to produce precipitation. At the moment, thermal</p>

<p>profiles would support rain as the primary p-type. While</p>

<p>confidence is low, a brief window of patchy freezing drizzle will</p>

<p>be possible across our far northwestern counties early Saturday</p>

<p>morning and early Sunday.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Attention then turns to a more potent system tracking across the</p>

<p>Rockies from the Pacific Northwest on Sunday. Latest guidance</p>

<p>suggests a slightly weaker system compared to previous runs;</p>

<p>however, models are in good agreement on its phase/timing. In</p>

<p>fact, models are now bringing a more progressive low, bringing</p>

<p>precipitation as early as Sunday night, moving out of our region</p>

<p>by early Monday evening. There is still a lot of uncertainty with</p>

<p>this system, though this storm has the potential to bring an</p>

<p>assortment of hazards, including rain, freezing rain, sleet, snow</p>

<p>and wind. Given warm air aloft, a wintry mix looks possible,</p>

<p>mainly across our half southern counties (mainly south of I-10).</p>

<p>Timing will be very important! If precipitation moves quick enough</p>

<p>to make it across southern/coastal areas before temps cool</p>

<p>near/below freezing, then rain/freezing rain/sleet will be</p>

<p>favored. Will continue to monitor different factors such as wet</p>

<p>bulb temperatures, lifting aloft and timing of stronger CAA</p>

<p>filtering in behind the system. Strong lift could result in</p>

<p>stronger cooling and a more rapid changeover to snow. No matter</p>

<p>the type of precipitation, a hazardous morning commute looks</p>

<p>possible.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Beyond Monday...models show another system with a potential for</p>

<p>winter weather conditions on Wednesday, but there is too much</p>

<p>uncertainty this far out.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Key Messages:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1) An extended period of well-below normal temperatures is</p>

<p>*** OVERVIEW ***</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Surge of Arctic air arrives on Saturday with temperatures</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; approaching freezing across most of the area by Sunday night.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * First of two disturbances arrives on Saturday, bringing mostly</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rain with higher chances of mixed precip north of I-10.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Second system arrives late Sunday into early Monday. With</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; colder temperatures in place, widespread wintry precipitation could</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; impact most of the area during this time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Behind the second system, prolonged stretch of below freezing</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and potentially historically low temperatures will last well into</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; next week. Another round of precipitation may arrive by mid-week.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A highly impactful and potentially historic period of prolonged cold</p>

<p>temperatures with multiple episodes of winter precipitation is</p>

<p>expected to impact SE Texas over the next week. With persistent deep</p>

<p>surface high pressure in place over the central CONUS, arctic air</p>

<p>will continue to push into the area as we head into the weekend. By</p>

<p>Saturday, high temperatures are unlikely to break out of the mid-40s</p>

<p>with lows approaching freezing north of the Houston metro. Our first</p>

<p>shot at winter precipitation will arrive on Saturday evening as an</p>

<p>upper shortwave trough pushes through the area. Precipitation type</p>

<p>will be highly dependent on the timing of this feature, though a</p>

<p>period of freezing drizzle/mixed-phase precipitation may occur north</p>

<p>of the Houston metro but elsewhere to the south model soundings</p>

<p>continue to favor a cold rain.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our main area of focus continues to be the arrival of a second, more</p>

<p>amplified shortwave on late Sunday into early Monday. As this</p>

<p>feature pushes towards SE TX and develops a slight negative tilt,</p>

<p>GFS/EC solutions indicate the formation of an associated coastal low</p>

<p>over the western Gulf of Mexico. PWs will remain in the vicinity of</p>

<p>1-1.25 in as this feature continues to develop, and model soundings</p>

<p>remain well-saturated. With lows on Sunday evening expected to dip</p>

<p>into the 20s to low 30s across the overwhelming majority of the</p>

<p>area, an impactful winter precipitation event is anticipated. While</p>

<p>precipitation type will remain highly dependent on the timing of</p>

<p>this system&#39;s arrival and the exact vertical temperature profiles</p>

<p>present across the area (i.e. the presence and extent of an elevated</p>

<p>warm layer), we are becoming increasingly confident in a widespread</p>

<p>mixed-phase event beginning Sunday night and persisting into Monday.</p>

<p>Global deterministic solutions continue to indicate the possibility</p>

<p>of snow, sleet, and freezing rain impacting portions of the area</p>

<p>during this time. This will make for a particularly hazardous</p>

<p>commute on Monday, particularly for those who travel on elevated</p>

<p>roadways or bridges. Surface streets may become involved as well</p>

<p>given these persistent cold temperatures. Travelers are urged to</p>

<p>pay close attention to the latest forecast as this situation</p>

<p>develops. Over the next few days, timing, amounts, and types of</p>

<p>precipitation will become more refined as higher- resolution</p>

<p>guidance becomes evaluable.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Upon the exit of the second system and subsequent clearing, SE TX</p>

<p>looks to experience its coldest night in many years on Monday</p>

<p>evening. Low temperatures across the Brazos Valley and other</p>

<p>northern zones remain progged to drop into the single digits, while</p>

<p>the Houston metro is expected to reach the low to mid 10s. Along the</p>

<p>barrier islands and coast, temperatures will still remain well below</p>

<p>freezing. Daily records are likely in play for several days at each</p>

<p>of our climate sites. These conditions will be extremely hazardous</p>

<p>to the &quot;4 Ps&quot; - people, pets, plants, and pipes. Consider the</p>

<p>actions you will need to take to ensure the protection of each of</p>

<p>these things. Risk may be further compounded by the possibility of</p>

<p>power outages given the expected winter precipitation earlier in</p>

<p>the day and increased energy demand for the heating of buildings.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Freezing temperatures are expected to last well into the upcoming</p>

<p>week, with lows remaining in the 20s for at least parts of the area</p>

<p>through next Thursday. Another episode of winter precipitation is</p>

<p>possible on Wednesday/early Thursday as a third upper trough pushes</p>

<p>through the area, though the timing of this system and temperature</p>

<p>profile across the area remains highly uncertain across model</p>

<p>solutions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now is the perfect time to prepare for this period of hazardous</p>

<p>weather. Be sure to have multiple ways to receive weather</p>

<p>information and continue to monitor the forecast, particularly if</p>

<p>you must travel this weekend and early next week.</p>

<p>531 AM CST Fri Feb 12 2021</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>.SHORT TERM [Today Through Saturday]...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Currently, most showers remain offshore of our region with</p>

<p>overcast skies and low clouds expected to persist throughout</p>

<p>today. Hi-res models suggest the highest rain chances will remain</p>

<p>offshore and along the coast due to a lingering frontal boundary</p>

<p>with perhaps some isolated and sporadic showers inland. High temps</p>

<p>will be in the upper 30s for our northernmost counties and the</p>

<p>lower-to-mid 40s everywhere else. Overnight lows tonight will be</p>

<p>only a few degrees colder than today&#39;s high temps with our</p>

<p>northernmost counties reaching near freezing and everywhere else</p>

<p>reaching the upper 30s.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As rain chances begin to increase on Saturday due to an</p>

<p>approaching upper-level shortwave trough, high temperatures are</p>

<p>not expected to breach the mid-40s. Global models have been</p>

<p>predicting warmer temps at the surface than what is expected, plus</p>

<p>diabatic cooling from precip can also cool the lower levels.</p>

<p>Therefore, depending on the timing of this precip, cold rain is</p>

<p>expected for most of our region, but periods of freezing drizzle</p>

<p>and other mixed-phase precip north of the Houston-metro area</p>

<p>cannot be ruled out.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>.LONG TERM [Saturday Night Through Friday]...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>*** OVERVIEW ***</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>* Bitterly cold air will be moving into the region into midweek as</p>

<p>&nbsp; an Arctic airmass spills into the area. Prolonged periods of</p>

<p>&nbsp; freezing temperatures are expected.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>* 3 separate weather systems are forecast to move across the</p>

<p>&nbsp; area...each bringing chances of some wintery precipitation to</p>

<p>&nbsp; parts of the region.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>* The combination of both the cold temperatures and winter</p>

<p>&nbsp; precipitation have the potential to significantly impact life and</p>

<p>&nbsp; property. Travel may be impacted by hazardous road conditions.</p>

<p>&nbsp; Sporadic power outages will be a possibility should we have</p>

<p>&nbsp; significant amounts of ice build up on powerlines and/or trees.</p>

<p>&nbsp; Pipes (including sprinkler systems) will be subject to bursting if</p>

<p>&nbsp; not adequately insulated, and hypothermia may be a possibility for</p>

<p>&nbsp; those exposed and not dressed accordingly. Residents should use</p>

<p>&nbsp; the next few days to prepare before the coldest air arrives.</p>

<p>&nbsp; Remember the 4 P&#39;s: pipes, people, pets and plants. In addition,</p>

<p>&nbsp; be aware of space heater dangers if not properly place/used.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first of the 3 systems will be arriving early Saturday evening</p>

<p>and overnight. The trof seen on w/v imagery over cntl Ca will dip</p>

<p>into northern Mexico then across the area. Temperatures, generally</p>

<p>north of Highway 105 will be near or below freezing as this occurs</p>

<p>and some freezing rain and sleet can be expected. Though overall</p>

<p>precip amounts shouldn&#39;t be all that impressive from a numbers</p>

<p>standpoint, it only takes a small glaze on the roads to cause</p>

<p>issues. Current forecast frozen accumulations are currently slightly</p>

<p>below Winter Storm Warning criteria, but wouldn&#39;t be surprised if a</p>

<p>Winter Weather Advisory might be needed at some point in the area</p>

<p>described above.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The second system is still on target to move in from the w/nw in the</p>

<p>midnight-noon timeframe Monday. This system will bring more</p>

<p>significant widespread frozen precip accumulations...perhaps as far</p>

<p>south as the coast. All combinations of wx are expected...starting</p>

<p>out as a ran-freezing rain-sleet event transitioning to a sleet-snow</p>

<p>mix across some inland portions as it exits the area. Consensus is</p>

<p>building that it&#39;ll be a somewhat progressive system - but not a fan</p>

<p>of starting out with ice covered with sleet/snow on top. Suspect a</p>

<p>Winter Storm Watch will be needed at some point this weekend</p>

<p>followed by a Warning for most of the area...assuming no significant</p>

<p>forecast changes between now and then.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Extremely cold air will filter into the area behind it with temps</p>

<p>falling thru the day and night. Lows are forecast to dip into the</p>

<p>single digits across northern parts of the CWA, teens into the</p>

<p>northern coastal counties and 20-25 at the beaches. Monday night/Tue</p>

<p>morning should be the coldest of the week. That said, some locations</p>

<p>might not see readings above the freezing mark for long durations.</p>

<p>As a rough estimate: northern parts of the CWA Mon morning til maybe</p>

<p>Wed morning, I-10 corridor Monday morning til maybe late Tue</p>

<p>afternoon (and only briefly til they fall again overnight), and</p>

<p>the beaches Mon morning til late Tue morning.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The third system, sometime between late Tues night and Wed night</p>

<p>depending on your model of choice, looks like a more traditional</p>

<p>sleet-snow setup with a coastal low positioned closer to the coast,</p>

<p>upper trof approaching from the west and favorable thickness values</p>

<p>dipping into the region. Have the least fcst confidence in regards</p>

<p>to the timing/details with this system of the three considering it&#39;s</p>

<p>so far out and lacks model consistency.&nbsp; 47</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>*** OVERVIEW ***</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>* As frigid arctic air pushes into SE Texas, 3 storm systems</p>

<p>&nbsp; are expected to bring periods of winter weather to the</p>

<p>&nbsp; region over the next 5-7 days which will have the potential</p>

<p>&nbsp; to pose a significant threat to life and property.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>* The arrival of the first system will bring periods of sleet</p>

<p>&nbsp; and freezing rain on Saturday night/early Sunday with the</p>

<p>&nbsp; greatest impacts north of the I-10 corridor.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>* A second, stronger disturbance combined with much below-</p>

<p>&nbsp; freezing temperatures will bring sleet, snow, and freezing rain</p>

<p>&nbsp; to all of SE Texas, causing significant disruptions to travel</p>

<p>&nbsp; and potential power outages. Near record cold temperatures will</p>

<p>&nbsp; develop as this system departs by Monday night.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>* A third round of sleet and freezing rain is possible Wednesday</p>

<p>&nbsp; into Thursday, though uncertainty surrounding this system</p>

<p>&nbsp; remains higher.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We continue to expect a significant and potentially historic period</p>

<p>of prolonged subfreezing temperatures with several rounds of winter</p>

<p>precipitation to impact SE Texas over the next week. As a persistent</p>

<p>deep area of surface high pressure remains the dominant synoptic</p>

<p>feature over the central third of the CONUS, moderate to strong</p>

<p>northerlies will continue to enhance CAA, with temperatures</p>

<p>remaining on a downward trend over the next several days. By late</p>

<p>Saturday, most locations will be at or near freezing with the</p>

<p>northern third of the area likely to see the 20s.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first of three upper shortwaves will traverse the area late</p>

<p>Saturday. Forecast soundings continue to be indicative of</p>

<p>sleet/freezing rain north of the Houston metro with a well-</p>

<p>saturated column and fairly deep elevated warm layer. Surface</p>

<p>/near-surface temps across and south of the metro area will be</p>

<p>less favorable for frozen precipitation, but travelers should</p>

<p>still remain highly vigilant of road conditions before heading</p>

<p>out. Behind the departure of this system, temperatures warm back</p>

<p>above freezing on Sunday afternoon but will remain well below</p>

<p>normal for mid-February (high 30s-mid 40s).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The main period of concern continues to be Sunday night through</p>

<p>Monday afternoon. As a second amplifying trough digs into central</p>

<p>TX, an associated coastal low will develop at the surface and push</p>

<p>into the central Gulf by late Sunday. Ample moisture associated with</p>

<p>this feature combined with subfreezing ambient conditions will</p>

<p>prove favorable for periods of snow, sleet, and freezing rain to</p>

<p>impact all of SE Texas. The most concerning period continues to be</p>

<p>the morning hours of Monday, where model soundings within Houston</p>

<p>metro show a highly favorable profile for freezing rain. In general,</p>

<p>precipitation should begin as mainly rain late on Sunday,</p>

<p>transitioning to sleet/freezing rain overnight and finally becoming</p>

<p>a mix of snow, sleet, and/or freezing rain during the day on Monday.</p>

<p>Snowfall accumulations will reach around 1-3&quot;, mainly to the north</p>

<p>of the Houston metro. Ice accumulations of 0.10 to 0.25&quot; are</p>

<p>possible across the metro northward with lower amounts southward.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This complex period of winter weather will create extremely</p>

<p>hazardous roadway conditions, particularly on Monday morning. Non-</p>

<p>essential travel should unequivocally be avoided during this time.</p>

<p>Snow accumulation and significant icing will cause widespread</p>

<p>impacts to road networks. Plan to remain where you are on Sunday</p>

<p>night for at least all of Monday.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the second system departs and clearing occurs, we&#39;ll enter what</p>

<p>will likely be the coldest night across SE Texas in approximately 30</p>

<p>years. Lows will dip into the single digits at most locations north</p>

<p>of I-10, with locations to the south reaching the 10s to lower 20s</p>

<p>along the coast. Temperature records are likely to fall. All</p>

<p>residents of SE Texas should begin to take steps to protect the 4 Ps</p>

<p>- people, plants, pets, and pipes. Due to the combined strain of</p>

<p>increased energy demands due to cold temperatures and previous</p>

<p>winter precipitation, there is also a distinct chance of power</p>

<p>outages during this time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We continue to monitor the development of a third system which may</p>

<p>bring additional freezing rain/sleet to the area on Wednesday and</p>

<p>Thursday. Given the timeframe and differences in model solutions,</p>

<p>there continues to be uncertainty surrounding this event. However,</p>

<p>there remains the potential for additional disruption due to winter</p>

<p>precipitation to occur through mid-week.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now is the time to prepare for this period of hazardous weather. Be</p>

<p>sure to have multiple ways to receive weather information and</p>

<p>continue to monitor the forecast.</p>

<p>whatsoever starting out with ice and expect this to cause numerous</p>

<p>impacts across the region. Precip will taper off by early afternoon.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Changes/tweaks made to the ongoing forecast include increasing snow</p>

<p>amounts, especially n/nw of Highway 59 where fcst soundings show the</p>

<p>warm nose eroding faster. Have storm totals of 3-4&quot; across northern</p>

<p>parts of the area tapering down to around 1/2&quot; just south of I-10</p>

<p>(this on top of ice). Though differing details between guidance,</p>

<p>several indicate the potential for significantly higher amounts with</p>

<p>banding and frontogenesis. Some models show prime upper jet</p>

<p>orientations to enhance over lift as well - but vary by model (LFQ</p>

<p>or RRQ). Also tweaked high temps down into midweek considering</p>

<p>frozen accumulations on the ground and lack of significant heating.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Highs for the day Monday will occur first thing in the morning</p>

<p>followed by continued falling readings thru the day. Bone chilling</p>

<p>readings in the single digits north and teens to low 20s coast are</p>

<p>expected Monday night.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tue night-Thurs system:</p>

<p>Heading into Tues night and Wed, a sfc coastal trough will begin</p>

<p>developing in advance of the next upper trof fcst to push thru later</p>

<p>this week. This will transport moisture back overhead. Look for</p>

<p>precip to begin developing Tue evening then expand in coverage</p>

<p>overnight and Wednesday. A mixed bag of precip is anticipated,</p>

<p>depending on geographic location and model of choice. Didn&#39;t dig too</p>

<p>much into the specifics with this system considering it&#39;s many days</p>

<p>away and guidance is bound to change a million times between now and</p>

<p>then. But, the potential is there for additional accumulations and</p>

<p>associated impacts especially further inland from the coast where</p>

<p>the thermal profile will be better.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Precip should clear out ~Thurs evening followed by a gradual warm-up</p>

<p>next weekend. 47</p>

<p>403 PM CST Sat Feb 13 2021</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>...Frigid, life and property threatening winter weather is still</p>

<p>expected to develop across much of Southeast Texas into Thursday...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>.DISCUSSION...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>* Bitterly cold air will continue moving into the region into</p>

<p>&nbsp; midweek as an Arctic airmass spills into the area. Prolonged</p>

<p>&nbsp; periods of below freezing temperatures are expected - even at</p>

<p>&nbsp; the beaches.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>* Two weather systems (one Sunday night-Monday morning and</p>

<p>&nbsp; another toward midweek) will produce winter precipitation across</p>

<p>&nbsp; many parts of Southeast Texas.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>* Travel will be impacted by hazardous road conditions. Sporadic</p>

<p>&nbsp; power outages will be a possibility where ice builds up on</p>

<p>&nbsp; powerlines and/or trees. Pipes (including sprinkler systems) will</p>

<p>&nbsp; be subject to bursting if not adequately insulated, and</p>

<p>&nbsp; hypothermia may be a possibility for those exposed and not dressed</p>

<p>&nbsp; accordingly.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>* Residents should complete preparations before the coldest air</p>

<p>&nbsp; and widespread frozen precipitation begins arriving Sunday</p>

<p>&nbsp; evening. Remember the 4 P&#39;s: pipes, people, pets and plants. In</p>

<p>&nbsp; addition, be aware of space heater and generator dangers if not</p>

<p>&nbsp; properly placed/used.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&amp;&amp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>.SHORT TERM [Tonight Through Monday]...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Temperatures so far today have been hovering around or slightly below</p>

<p>freezing across our northwest counties, mid to upper 30s central and</p>

<p>lower to mid 40s coast. Almost nothing has been showing up on radar,</p>

<p>but that will change beginning tonight as the first disturbance moves</p>

<p>across the area and produces frozen precipitation north (where lows</p>

<p>will be near or slightly below freezing) and rain to the south (where</p>

<p>temperatures above freezing are expected). At 9 PM, the Winter Storm</p>

<p>Warning begins up north, and the Winter Storm Watch begins down south.</p>

<p>For the most part, light accumulations are expected overnight through</p>

<p>much of tomorrow morning with this first system, but any accumulations</p>

<p>in/near the warning area will lead to hazardous conditions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>High resolution models coming in are painting a potentially very dangerous</p>

<p>winter weather event over at least the next 48 hours (through Monday),</p>

<p>and with a long period of below freezing temperatures, very dangerous</p>

<p>conditions look to be setting up for parts of the area Tuesday through</p>

<p>Thursday night (see the Long Term section below).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The stronger system begins tomorrow afternoon and peaks tomorrow night</p>

<p>through early Monday morning. The Winter Storm Watch is upgraded to</p>

<p>a Winter Storm Warning at 3 PM Sunday, and this places the entire area</p>

<p>under the Warning through Monday afternoon. As temperatures fall from</p>

<p>Sunday afternoon through Monday morning, expect to see periods of rain</p>

<p>mixed with freezing rain/drizzle up north that will eventually transition</p>

<p>to snow, and expect to see periods of rain transitioning to rain mixed</p>

<p>with freezing rain/drizzle that eventually could transition to snow</p>

<p>down south...including the beaches. High resolution models coming in</p>

<p>are showing the potential for 1 to 3 inches of snow north (locally</p>

<p>higher amounts possible) with lower amounts as you get closer to the</p>

<p>coast. Further to the south, freezing rain accumulations may reach</p>

<p>a tenth to a quarter inch. If this happens, expect to see sporadic</p>

<p>power outages where the buildup occurs on powerlines and/or trees.</p>

<p>Pipes (including sprinkler systems) will be subject to bursting if</p>

<p>not adequately insulated, and hypothermia may be a possibility for</p>

<p>those exposed and not dressed accordingly. Monday&#39;s high temperatures</p>

<p>will struggle to get any warmer than the teens north and west and the</p>

<p>20s south and coast. A Hard Freeze Watch and a Wind Chill Watch begin</p>

<p>at 6 PM Monday for the entire area, and they will likely need to be</p>

<p>upgraded to a Warning.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You only have about one day left to prepare for this potentially historic</p>

<p>winter event!&nbsp; 42</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&amp;&amp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>.LONG TERM [Monday Night Through Saturday]...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the first round of winter precipitation comes to an end on</p>

<p>Monday afternoon, the other dangerous hazard going into the</p>

<p>overnight hours will be the extremely dangerous low temperatures. On</p>

<p>Tuesday morning, lows will be near zero in our northern counties,</p>

<p>around 10-15 degrees near Houston and in the upper-teens/lower 20s</p>

<p>along the coast. None of the winter precipitation will melt, so</p>

<p>travel conditions will be extremely hazardous through at least</p>

<p>Tuesday afternoon. This arctic air will be very frigid, and those</p>

<p>without the proper attire will be at risk of hypothermia if outdoors</p>

<p>for an extended period of time. For Tuesday, areas north of I-10</p>

<p>will likely remain below freezing even into the afternoon hours, so</p>

<p>any winter precipitation that has previously fallen will remain and</p>

<p>so will the hazardous travel conditions. South of I-10, temperatures</p>

<p>will make it into the mid-to-upper 30s and lower 40s along the</p>

<p>coast.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A surface coastal low begins to develop late Tuesday night/early</p>

<p>Wednesday morning. This will bring another round of precipitation to</p>

<p>the area throughout the day on Wednesday and into Thursday morning.</p>

<p>Model guidance is still iffy on the temperatures as far as the</p>

<p>freezing line goes. There is consistency that the initial surge of</p>

<p>moisture comes early on Wednesday when our northern counties will</p>

<p>still be below freezing. Forecast soundings support a freezing</p>

<p>rain/sleet mix initially for this area. Temperatures expected to</p>

<p>rise above freezing in the afternoon hours, so a transition over to</p>

<p>rain is anticipated during this timeframe. As far as the Wednesday</p>

<p>temperatures go, it&#39;ll be close (talking a 1-2 degree difference)</p>

<p>for our far northern counties on if they get above freezing. GFS and</p>

<p>Euro are in agreement on a transition back to freezing rain going</p>

<p>into Wednesday night for our northern counties as temperatures begin</p>

<p>to fall, followed by a transition to snow on early Thursday morning</p>

<p>as the precipitation finally comes to an end. Overnight temperatures</p>

<p>for Wednesday will drop below freezing once again for most of the</p>

<p>area (the exception being along the coast and our far southeastern</p>

<p>locations). With ground temperatures likely not recovering enough,</p>

<p>we could have another period of hazardous travel conditions for</p>

<p>Wednesday night/Thursday.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This may sound like a broken record, but high temperatures on</p>

<p>Thursday are likely to remain below freezing once again for our</p>

<p>northern counties. It is a very real possibility that our northern</p>

<p>locations may not reach above 32 degrees until Friday. Further to</p>

<p>south, temperatures will make it into the upper 30s/low 40s. The</p>

<p>somewhat good news is that high pressure will be moving in from the</p>

<p>west, so we&#39;ll see clearing skies and an end to the winter</p>

<p>precipitation. The mostly clear skies combined with continued CAA</p>

<p>with northerly winds flowing over the ice that will still be in</p>

<p>place to the north means we&#39;re expecting another hard freeze for</p>

<p>Thursday night with temperatures down into the teens up north and in</p>

<p>the 20s near the Houston metro area and south. High pressure moves</p>

<p>off to the east on Friday and puts us into a southerly flow.</p>

<p>Temperatures will FINALLY get out of the 30s as we see high</p>

<p>temperatures back into the 40s/50s which seems rather warm in</p>

<p>comparison. Southerly flow continues into Saturday where we will</p>

<p>likely see temperatures rise into the 60s. How&#39;s that for a</p>

<p>temperature swing?&nbsp; 26</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>.SHORT TERM [Tonight Through Monday]...</p>

<p>As the shortwave trough continues to push out this morning,</p>

<p>spotty areas of freezing drizzle and wintry precip are possible,</p>

<p>leading to hazardous conditions for areas near or below freezing.</p>

<p>Daytime highs will be below freezing for northern counties, in the</p>

<p>mid-30s for central counties, and upper-30s near 40 for southern</p>

<p>and coastal counties.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The strong, arctic front will begin to push through this afternoon,</p>

<p>peak tonight, and continue through early Monday morning. A Winter</p>

<p>Storm Warning is in effect for counties north of Harris County, but</p>

<p>remaining counties will be upgraded to the the Winter Storm Warning</p>

<p>at 3PM this afternoon. This warning will remain in effect through</p>

<p>tomorrow afternoon. In addition, a hard freeze watch and a wind</p>

<p>chill watch is in place for all counties tonight due to low</p>

<p>temperatures dropping to the 20s for southern counties, the teens</p>

<p>for central counties, and single digits for our far northern</p>

<p>counties. However, this hard freeze watch and wind chill watch is</p>

<p>expected to be upgraded to a warning later today.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For our northern counties, expect to see rain mixed with frozen</p>

<p>precip such as frozen drizzle and ice pellets, then transition to</p>

<p>snow. This pattern of rain transitioning to a wintry mix</p>

<p>transitioning to snow will progress further south throughout the day</p>

<p>and eventually reach the coast. High resolution models are showing</p>

<p>snow accumulations of 2-5 inches for our northern counties and up to</p>

<p>3 inches everywhere else. Isolated heavier amounts are possible with</p>

<p>models indicating localized, heavier bands. Total ice accumulations</p>

<p>are expected to reach 0.10 to 0.25 inches across our CWA with, once</p>

<p>again, locally heavier amounts possible. With ice accumulation,</p>

<p>power outages are possible due to freezing rain and ice buildup</p>

<p>along trees and powerlines. Pipes will be subject to bursting if not</p>

<p>properly insulated. Overall, these high resolution models are still</p>

<p>depicting a very dangerous winter weather event for much of Texas</p>

<p>now through Monday.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Monday&#39;s high temperatures will stay well below freezing with most</p>

<p>areas in the teens and low 20s. Below freezing temps are expected to</p>

<p>be long in duration with no signs of relief in the short-term.</p>

<p>Therefore, no winter precip is expected to melt, so travel</p>

<p>conditions will continue to be very hazardous. This extreme arctic</p>

<p>air will be very frigid, and those without the proper attire will be</p>

<p>at risk of hypothermia if outdoors for an extended period of time.</p>

<p>Precip should mostly be done by Mon evening. However, dangerously</p>

<p>cold wx continues with temps falling into the low single digits</p>

<p>toward College Station and upper teens at the beaches overnight.</p>

<p>Wind chills will be below up to -10F at some locations.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many locations north of I-10 won&#39;t make it above freezing til</p>

<p>Wed...and then only for a short time period until the next system</p>

<p>rolls in.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Tues, sfc high pres will be edging to the east and expect a</p>

<p>coastal low to begin developing along the middle Tx coast in</p>

<p>advance of the next upper trof and storm system. This will bring</p>

<p>some slightly modified/warmer air (35-40F) to coastal locations,</p>

<p>but will also begin drawing moisture back into the region. Look</p>

<p>for increasing precip/coverage Tue night into Wed will inland.</p>

<p>With readings still below freezing inland, expect this to pose</p>

<p>another freezing rain threat across inland parts of the region</p>

<p>during that time period. The coastal trof should move ene along</p>

<p>the Upper Texas coast during the day Wed followed by upper trof</p>

<p>Wed night &amp; Thurs. It&#39;ll be during that time where precip</p>

<p>transitions to sleet/snow for, as of now, what looks to be north-</p>

<p>northwest of the Highway 59 &amp; US-69 corridor. Too early for</p>

<p>reliable specifics in regards to frozen accumulations, but it does</p>

<p>appear likely and another impactful winter event for some</p>

<p>unfortunately. Temperatures will again fall below freezing across</p>

<p>the vast majority of the area in the wake of this system.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>High pressure will move off to the east late Friday which should</p>

<p>...Frigid, life and property threatening and potentially historic winter</p>

<p>weather events can be expected across much of Southeast Texas through</p>

<p>Thursday Night...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>No significant changes have been made to to the highlights below.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>* Bitterly cold air will continue moving into the region through</p>

<p>&nbsp; midweek as an Arctic airmass spills into the area. Prolonged</p>

<p>&nbsp; periods of below freezing and near all time record cold</p>

<p>&nbsp; temperatures are expected - even at the beaches.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>* Two weather systems (one tonight through Monday morning and&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; another one toward midweek) will produce winter precipitation</p>

<p>&nbsp; across many parts of Southeast Texas.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>* Travel will be impacted by hazardous road conditions. Sporadic</p>

<p>&nbsp; power outages will be a possibility where ice builds up on</p>

<p>&nbsp; powerlines and/or trees. Pipes (including sprinkler systems)</p>

<p>&nbsp; will be subject to bursting if not adequately insulated, and</p>

<p>&nbsp; severe hypothermia may be highly possible for those exposed and</p>

<p>&nbsp; not dressed accordingly.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>* Residents should rush to completion all of their preparations</p>

<p>&nbsp; this afternoon through early this evening before the arrival of</p>

<p>&nbsp; the coldest air and widespread frozen precipitation this evening</p>

<p>&nbsp; and overnight. Remember the 4 P&#39;s: pipes, people, pets and</p>

<p>&nbsp; dangers if not properly placed/used.</p>

<p>.SHORT TERM [Tonight Through Monday]...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Major winter weather event (a mix of rain, freezing rain, sleet and</p>

<p>snow) will continue to unfold during the remaining afternoon hours,</p>

<p>on through this evening and overnight, and then come to an end from</p>

<p>west to east during the morning hours on Monday as the storm system</p>

<p>moves into and across the state. Look for precipitation coverage on</p>

<p>radar to continue to increase this afternoon and peak during the</p>

<p>overnight and early morning hours. Locations that are already at</p>

<p>or below freezing (mainly northern and western areas) can expect</p>

<p>to see mainly sleet and snow while locations that are near or slightly</p>

<p>above freezing (mainly southern and eastern areas) can expect rain</p>

<p>and freezing rain to more gradually transition to sleet and snow</p>

<p>as temperatures work their way downward. Models generally support</p>

<p>locations up north (CLL to Crockett areas) to receive the higher</p>

<p>snowfall totals of 4 to 6 inches with locally higher amounts,</p>

<p>locations around and to the north of the I-10 to I-59/69 corridor</p>

<p>to receive 1 to 3 inches with locally higher amounts, and near the</p>

<p>coast light accumulations. Areas that remain near or above freezing</p>

<p>the longest have the potential to receive the highest and most</p>

<p>dangerous ice accumulation potentials of 1/10 to 1/4 inch (again,</p>

<p>locally higher amounts possible), and this looks like it might set</p>

<p>up near/around the Houston area and especially for locations off</p>

<p>to their east and southeast. As usual, winter precipitation forecast</p>

<p>is quite challenging for Southeast Texas, and would not be at all</p>

<p>surprised if there are slight shifts in the exact higher amount</p>

<p>locations. With the entire area under a Winter Storm Warning, a</p>

<p>Hard Freeze Warning and a Wind Chill Warning, everyone should rush</p>

<p>to completion all preparations for this major winter weather event.</p>

<p>After the precip event comes to an end from west to east on Monday</p>

<p>morning and afternoon highs struggle to remain in the upper teens</p>

<p>to mid 20s (maybe near 30 at the coast), bitterly cold temperatures</p>

<p>and wind chills will become our next concern as we head on into</p>

<p>Monday night.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please stay safe out there, remain home and do not travel! 42</p>

<p>.LONG TERM [Monday Night Through Sunday]...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Round one of the winter precipitation will have come to an end by</p>

<p>Monday night. Monday night/Tuesday morning will feature extremely</p>

<p>dangerous arctic temperatures. Low temperatures will be in the</p>

<p>single digits for our northern and western counties, 10-12 degrees</p>

<p>around the Houston metro area, and in the teens further to the south</p>

<p>and along the coast. Wind chill values will be well below zero out</p>

<p>to the north and west and in the single digits elsewhere. Please</p>

<p>take these hazards seriously. The ice and snow will not melt and</p>

<p>hazardous travel conditions will remain in place. Travel is HIGHLY</p>

<p>discouraged through at least Tuesday. Minimize your time outdoors</p>

<p>and wear proper attire if you go outside. You will be at risk of</p>

<p>hypothermia if outdoors for an extended period of time. Afternoon</p>

<p>temperatures on Tuesday are not expected to get above freezing for</p>

<p>most locations north of I-10, so the ice and snow will remain in</p>

<p>place on the roads. It&#39;s not until Wednesday where a brief period of</p>

<p>above-freezing temperatures come into the area as another coastal</p>

<p>low develops and initially pushes in some slightly warmer air. High</p>

<p>temperatures on Wednesday will be in the 30s/40s for inland areas</p>

<p>and in the 50s along the coast. Model consensus is not entirely</p>

<p>there as far as who gets freezing rain and who gets liquid rain</p>

<p>initially on Wednesday morning along with the extent of the</p>

<p>moisture. Our northern counties have the highest chance of seeing</p>

<p>freezing rain in the morning hours before a transition over to rain</p>

<p>as temperatures warm above freezing. Favorable jet mechanics will be</p>

<p>in place with divergence aloft, but differences remain in models on</p>

<p>how quickly the moisture moves out of the area. Current thinking is</p>

<p>that moisture sticks around into Wednesday night/Thursday morning,</p>

<p>so as temperatures drop below freezing we will see a transition over</p>

<p>to winter precipitation at the tail end on Thursday morning for</p>

<p>areas north of I-10. Uncertainty remains on if the winter</p>

<p>precipitation will be freezing rain, sleet, or snow, but leaning</p>

<p>more towards another freezing rain event.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>High pressure moves into the area on Thursday and we&#39;ll see clearing</p>

<p>skies with temperatures in the 30s and 40s. Below freezing</p>

<p>temperatures likely to remain in our far northern counties due to</p>

<p>feature another hard freeze with temperatures dropping into the</p>

<p>radiational cooling underneath the mostly clear skies. We won&#39;t be</p>

<p>..SHORT TERM [Tonight Through Tuesday]...</p>

<p>Well...it&#39;s here. Ice, sleet &amp; snow. Some thunderssleet/now mixed</p>

<p>in for fun - even at the the beaches. Bulk of the precip should</p>

<p>be out of here by mid morning with some lingering flurries into</p>

<p>the afternoon. Bitterly cold air continues to filter in and the</p>

<p>majority of the area has, or are currently sitting at their</p>

<p>daytime highs. Interestingly, wind direction is such where we</p>

<p>wouldn&#39;t be totally surprised to see some &quot;lake effect&quot; snow</p>

<p>flurries along some of the nnw-sse oriented waters or Galveston</p>

<p>Bay into tonight. Of course, don&#39;t have experience forecasting</p>

<p>such things...but may be interesting to see as some of the hires</p>

<p>guidance hints at.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Went with the lowest-of-the-low hires model guidance and cut</p>

<p>another degree or two for overnight lows. Wouldn&#39;t be surprised to</p>

<p>see some readings bottom out below zero across northern parts of</p>

<p>the area. Temperatures will remain below freezing at the beaches</p>

<p>until late Tues...and quite possibly until Friday across the</p>

<p>northern 1/4 of the CWA.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As sfc high pressure edges east and the next storm system</p>

<p>approaches from the west, we&#39;ll see a coastal trof set up during</p>

<p>the day Tues, leading us into round #2 for potential frozen</p>

<p>precip for some parts of the area. Keep in mind...accumulations</p>

<p>that are out there right now aren&#39;t going away across the northern</p>

<p>half of the area ahead of the next system... 47</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&amp;&amp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>.LONG TERM [Tuesday Night Through Sunday]...</p>

<p>Overnight temperatures on Tuesday will warm by over 20 degrees</p>

<p>across some parts of the area when compared to the previous night</p>

<p>due to increased cloud cover and WAA from onshore flow. Temps</p>

<p>will be near 40 along the coast and in our southern counties, near</p>

<p>30 for central counties, and the mid-20s for northern counties. A</p>

<p>drastic improvement from the single digits and teens the night</p>

<p>before, though still very cold.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>By Wednesday, a coastal low is expected to develop ahead of the next</p>

<p>front. That continued onshore flow and increased cloud coverage will</p>

<p>help increase temperatures once again. GFS and Euro are showing</p>

<p>850mb temp advection near 20-25 C/hr.&nbsp; However, central and northern</p>

<p>counties will still only reach daytime highs of near or below</p>

<p>freezing. That being said, with forecast soundings showing a large</p>

<p>pocket of warm air aloft and a very shallow below freezing layer</p>

<p>near the surface, and surface temps at or below freezing for</p>

<p>northern and central counties, the return of wintry precipitation is</p>

<p>expected. Right now profiles indicate a freezing rain type event,</p>

<p>once again, with the northern counties having the highest chances.</p>

<p>Along the coast it is expected to be too warm, so only cold rain is</p>

<p>expected with this system. The GFS and Euro both show some wrap-</p>

<p>around precip behind this front as it pushes out on Thursday. Both</p>

<p>models show an upper-level jet streak forming north of our CWA with</p>

<p>our far northern counties underneath the left entrance region. These</p>

<p>favorable upper-level dynamics as well as strong CAA behind the</p>

<p>front will bring possible snow to our northern counties once again</p>

<p>late Wed/early Thursday.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thursday through Saturday will see drastic improvements in</p>

<p>conditions with a gradual warming trend due to a high pressure</p>

<p>settling in. Overnight lows will dive back down to below freezing</p>

<p>Thursday night in the wake of Wednesday&#39;s front. That should be</p>

<p>short-lived as skies clear, allowing daytime heating in addition to</p>

<p>the return of onshore flow which will bring back some much needed</p>

<p>WAA. Temps will reach back to the 40s by Friday and then the 50s and</p>

<p>60s by Saturday.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Towards the end of the long-term forecast period, another shortwave</p>

<p>trough develops over the North Central Plains on Sunday and Monday</p>

<p>and the resultant surface front is expected to push through our CWA.</p>

<p>Fortunately, it is expected to remain warm enough for just a rain</p>

<p>event, no snow or wintry mix. KBL</p>

<p>...BITTERLY COLD TEMPERATURES EXPECTED TONIGHT AND INTO TUESDAY</p>

<p>MORNING...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Arctic high pressure will continue to settle across the region</p>

<p>tonight, with the core of the coldest air upon us. With 925mb</p>

<p>temperatures from -2 to -15 C over our area, dangerously cold</p>

<p>temperatures are expected tonight. Overnight lows will plummet</p>

<p>into the single digits across most of the region, and into the mid</p>

<p>to upper teens along the coast. Fortunately, pressure gradient</p>

<p>relaxes as the surface ridge settles in, leaving us with</p>

<p>relatively light winds through the night. However, dangerous wind</p>

<p>chill values are still expected, mainly early Tuesday morning.</p>

<p>Wind chills from the single digits to teens below are expected</p>

<p>north of I-10 and in the single digits above south of I-10. A Wind</p>

<p>Chill Warning and a Hard Freeze remain in effect until noon</p>

<p>Tuesday.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The good news is that no precipitation is expected, at least</p>

<p>through late Tuesday. Surface high pressure gradually moves east</p>

<p>throughout the day on Tuesday, shifting winds from the east, then</p>

<p>southeast by the afternoon. Temperatures will only make it into</p>

<p>the mid 20s to low 30s north of I-10 and into the mid 30s to low</p>

<p>40s along the coast. 05</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>.LONG TERM [Tuesday Night Through Monday]...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another storm system will approach from the west on Tuesday night</p>

<p>and produce a round of precipitation beginning late Tuesday evening</p>

<p>and continuing through Wednesday night. The thermal profile favors</p>

<p>rain and freezing rain for most of this event, so it is critical as</p>

<p>to where surface freezing temperatures will be present around</p>

<p>midnight Wednesday. Thinking that coastal areas will see some</p>

<p>warming due to modification of the cold airmass and the freezing</p>

<p>rain threat will begin a little south of I-10 for western areas,</p>

<p>with Houston right on the southern edge of the threat. During the</p>

<p>day on Wednesday, temperatures will warm some and the freezing rain</p>

<p>threat will lift northward, but remain for far northern areas. Some</p>

<p>additional light sleet and freezing rain are possible across the</p>

<p>same area as the storm system is exiting off to the east late</p>

<p>Wednesday night. Ice accumulations are likely to range from a little</p>

<p>less than a tenth of an inch for south central areas to around a</p>

<p>quarter of an inch across northern areas. Note, a half inch is</p>

<p>possible around Crockett and Trinity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Behind this storm system, cold air will surge south again with an</p>

<p>inland hard freeze expected Friday morning. Min temperatures will</p>

<p>likely be back in the teens across NW areas with mid 20s across</p>

<p>central and inland areas. By Friday afternoon, with abundant</p>

<p>sunshine, the entire area should warm above freezing; however,</p>

<p>northern areas will only reach the mid to upper 30s. A more</p>

<p>significant warmup begins on Saturday and continues the rest of the</p>

<p>weekend.</p>

<p>444 AM CST Tue Feb 16 2021</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>...Bitterly cold temperatures today...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>...Significant ice storm tonight and Wednesday for portions of</p>

<p>southeast Texas...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>.SHORT TERM [Today Through Thursday]...</p>

<p>Today:</p>

<p>Very cold with temperatures starting out in the single digits to</p>

<p>teens and wind chills near or below zero. Axis of surface high</p>

<p>pressure edges to the east and a coastal trof begins developing.</p>

<p>Look for increasing cloud cover across coastal and w/sw parts of</p>

<p>the region and Gulf moisture begins overspreading the cold airmass</p>

<p>at the surface. Scattered light precipitation will begin</p>

<p>developing offshore later in the day.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This evening into around noon Wednesday:</p>

<p>Coastal trof will become better established and a low pressure</p>

<p>area will develop south of the Matagorda Bay area. Light</p>

<p>precipitation will begin spreading inland...first across southwest</p>

<p>parts of the CWA then northeast across the remainder of the area</p>

<p>overnight as the coastal low treks across the upper Tx coastal</p>

<p>waters and some lead shortwaves from the upper trough to the west</p>

<p>skirt across northern half of the area.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The freeze line around sunset should be situated from roughly the</p>

<p>northern Matagorda Bay area to Houston to Winnie. Although precip</p>

<p>will initially be light, those at or below the freezing mark will</p>

<p>see roads/bridges begin to ice.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Going into the midnight hour and beyond, the freeze line should</p>

<p>VERY VERY slowly edge north, but precip intensity/amounts will</p>

<p>increase. Locations north of the Highway 59 - Interstate 10</p>

<p>corridor become much more troublesome with some significant icing</p>

<p>as the night wears on. Extremely concerned for the northern half</p>

<p>of the CWA especially north of Highway 105 where ice accumulations</p>

<p>should average nearly 1/4&quot;. Some guidance - notably HREF members,</p>

<p>indicate the *potential* for significantly more amounts</p>

<p>(0.5-1.0&quot;+). Most favored locations would be northeast parts</p>

<p>(Madison, Walker, Polk, Trinity and Houston Co&#39;s). Should these</p>

<p>type amounts actually occur...this would cause devastating</p>

<p>impacts to structures, powerlines and agriculture.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wednesday afternoon and night:</p>

<p>Surface temps should climb above freezing for most of the area,</p>

<p>though there will remain lingering ice at many locations</p>

<p>especially north of the metro area. Anything that melts could very</p>

<p>well freeze over again Wednesday night. In addition, with any</p>

<p>lingering moisture left - additional disturbances moving across</p>

<p>the region Wed night into Thurs morning will have the potential to</p>

<p>produce some snow/sleet...though negligible accumulations &lt;1/2&quot;</p>

<p>(considering the earlier precip and impacts).&nbsp; 47</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&amp;&amp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>.LONG TERM [Thursday Night Through Tuesday]...</p>

<p>In the wake of the Wednesday/Thursday&#39;s front, a high pressure will</p>

<p>begin to settle in over Texas and the long awaited warming trend</p>

<p>will finally arrive. Clear skies on Friday will allow temperatures</p>

<p>to reach the 40s on Friday. On Saturday, the return of southerly</p>

<p>winds and its corresponding WAA will drive temperatures up even</p>

<p>further to the 60s along the coast and mid-50s everywhere else.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>By Sunday, a negatively tilted trough is expected to be over the</p>

<p>Four-Corners region in the Western US, and its associated surface</p>

<p>cold front will be approaching Texas. For our CWA, onshore flow will</p>

<p>strengthen and global models are indicating some rain chances</p>

<p>offshore and along the coast. However, forecast soundings don&#39;t look</p>

<p>that promising with plenty of dry air and a capping inversion near</p>

<p>the surface and near 850mb. Therefore, any precip that might try to</p>

<p>form offshore and along the coast will be shallow and stratiform.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>By Monday, rain chances will increase as the previously</p>

<p>aforementioned cold front is expected to push through SE TX. The GFS</p>

<p>and Canadian models are handling these next rain chances similarly,</p>

<p>with a broad swath of rain pushing through our region and leaving</p>

<p>our area by early Tuesday morning. However, the ECMWF is keeping</p>

<p>most precip to our west and offshore as the cold front develops just</p>

<p>west of our CWA. This far out, these models are definitely going to</p>

<p>change, so as of right now, expect another round of rain on Monday,</p>

<p>but timing, location, and duration are uncertain for now. KBL</p>

<p>.SHORT TERM [Tonight Through Wednesday Night]...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Weather conditions will be deteriorating tonight as low pressure</p>

<p>develops south of the Matagorda Bay area. As this low moves into</p>

<p>our coastal waters overnight and on through the waters Wednesday</p>

<p>morning, light precipitation will develop and spread inland while</p>

<p>shortwaves from the upper trof to our west scrape across the northern</p>

<p>parts of our area. Some icing could develop this evening where</p>

<p>precipitation falls near areas around freezing. The real mess looks</p>

<p>to begin to develop after midnight as the freezing line moves slowly</p>

<p>inland. Expecting increasing precipitation coverage during the</p>

<p>overnight through morning hours with significant icing possible</p>

<p>the further north you go. After looking at area soundings and model</p>

<p>trends, it still looks like locations north of Highway 105 will have</p>

<p>the greatest potential for the highest ice accumulation totals of</p>

<p>around 1/4 inch or higher. If this occurs, there could be devastating</p>

<p>impacts to structures, powerlines and agriculture. Of course, driving</p>

<p>should not occur - Stay home! Even areas south of Highway 105 to the</p>

<p>I-10 corridor will be susceptible to icing with potential totals of</p>

<p>around 1/10 to 1/4 inch (1/10 closer to I-10 and 1/4 closer to Highway</p>

<p>105). Again, the safety risk is too great to get on the roads - Stay</p>

<p>home! Improving conditions do not look to occur until late tomorrow</p>

<p>morning or early tomorrow afternoon when activity starts to come to</p>

<p>an end from west to east. With temperatures not expected to rise much</p>

<p>above freezing tomorrow afternoon (especially up north), any freezing</p>

<p>ice that has accumulated will be sticking around, and any melted ice</p>

<p>will freeze over again tomorrow night through Thursday morning with</p>

<p>temperatures in the 20s/30s.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hang in there...warmer temperatures are coming! 42</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&amp;&amp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>.LONG TERM [Thursday Through Monday]...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Residual moisture in the wake of the departing surface low/cold</p>

<p>front may result in some lingering wintry precipitation heading into</p>

<p>Thursday morning, with light snow showers/sleet/ice pellets a</p>

<p>possibility. That being said, impacts from this spotty precipitation</p>

<p>are likely to be minor in comparison to the weather we anticipate</p>

<p>impacting the area in the immediate term. Behind the departing</p>

<p>system, northerly winds will result in another frigid day across SE</p>

<p>TX, with highs in the mid-30s inland to low 40s near the coast and</p>

<p>widespread overnight lows in the upper teens to low 20s. Actions to</p>

<p>protect people, pets, plants, and pipes from the persistent extreme</p>

<p>cold should be continued during this time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yet another unseasonably cold day, though a drier one, is in store</p>

<p>on Friday as high pressure remains dominant over the South Central</p>

<p>CONUS. However, as this surface high pushes eastward as we reach</p>

<p>Saturday, a long-awaited warming trend will begin as we finally see</p>

<p>the re-emergence of an onshore flow pattern. As a result, highs on</p>

<p>Saturday break into the 50s while on Sunday temperatures reach the</p>

<p>mid to upper 60s at most locations.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Increasing moisture upon the redevelopment of southerly winds will</p>

<p>push total PWs back towards the vicinity of 1.0 in on Sunday</p>

<p>afternoon. Our next chance at precipitation (thankfully, it looks</p>

<p>like purely a rain event this time) will come on late Sunday/early</p>

<p>Monday as a surface cold front traverses the area and produces</p>

<p>scattered showers. The surge of cold air behind this departing</p>

<p>boundary will be comparatively weaker and far less persistent, with</p>

<p>lows not reaching below freezing in its wake on Monday night and</p>

<p>highs returning to the upper 60s/mid 70s by Tuesday afternoon.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>...Winter Storm Warning In Effect Through Noon Thursday...</p>

<p>...Ice Storm to Impact The Region...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>.SHORT TERM [Today Through Thursday Afternoon]...</p>

<p>Much of the forecast today through Thursday focuses around the</p>

<p>temperatures across the region and the associated freezing rain</p>

<p>and rain occurrence. The freezing line at 4 am stretched from</p>

<p>Columbus to Conroe to Cleveland but with T/Td spreads to the south</p>

<p>of there leaving room to wetbulb so will expect temperatures in</p>

<p>the &#39;warmer&#39; sector to cool down to freezing as precipitation</p>

<p>rates increase this morning. Winter Storm Warning location remains</p>

<p>the same and still expect the southernmost edge of the warning</p>

<p>(roughly right along the Highway 59 corridor) to get some very</p>

<p>minor icy buildups. These areas to the north of the 59 corridor</p>

<p>are the issue where ice accumulations will range from just a few</p>

<p>hundredths of an inch to 0.25&quot; or more. Freezing rain will be</p>

<p>depositing quickly on surfaces after this hard freeze we just had</p>

<p>and with some leftover sleet/snow on the ground temperatures will</p>

<p>be at or below freezing over the winter storm warning area. This</p>

<p>is very problematic allowing the freezing rain to collect on all</p>

<p>surfaces. Roads are going to get treacherous with icing and</p>

<p>bridges will of course be accumulating the ice as will elevated</p>

<p>surfaces/vegetation/powerlines and so on. Gradually temperatures</p>

<p>will warm as the profile becomes saturated near the surface and</p>

<p>strong WAA remains this afternoon. The freezing line should creep</p>

<p>northward this morning then this afternoon likely speed up moving</p>

<p>from around a Columbus to Conroe to Goodrich line perhaps as far</p>

<p>north as Bellville to Huntsville to Groveton line before cooling</p>

<p>takes over and WAA wanes/shifts east. The heaviest of the freezing</p>

<p>rain should be over the northern and northeastern portions of the</p>

<p>area and 0.1-0.25&quot; of freezing rain should be common there. Some</p>

<p>isolated amounts in excess of 0.5&quot; will be possible. That is a lot</p>

<p>of ice and impacts could be severe. Although as surface</p>

<p>temperatures warm above freezing the precip that falls switches</p>

<p>over to rain it will still be falling on ice crusted surfaces.</p>

<p>Some of the ice will melt but the damage will be done at that</p>

<p>point. Travel is not good idea as the icy accumulations of the</p>

<p>precipitation begins will be abrupt and driving conditions that</p>

<p>were clear could change over in just a few blocks to a skating</p>

<p>rink! Ice accumulations like this can quickly cause tree limbs to</p>

<p>snap and fall posing another life threatening impact, along with</p>

<p>bringing down powerlines. Already the region is suffering from</p>

<p>power outages and again these could worsen with the icing. Roads,</p>

<p>sidewalks, stairs will become treacherous with the icing. This</p>

<p>afternoon as a surface low tracks across the coastal waters and</p>

<p>into Louisiana northerly winds will increase and begin to push</p>

<p>the cold air south again. Temperatures in the wake of the</p>

<p>associated cold front should fall back below freezing so wet</p>

<p>surfaces are going to freeze up late this afternoon/early this</p>

<p>evening. Travel will continue to be very difficult. Even the</p>

<p>coastal counties that have been spared the freezing rain today will</p>

<p>have to deal with the wet ground freezing up in some places by 5</p>

<p>am Thursday. In the wake of the front Thursday morning a band of</p>

<p>some light snow/sleet will be possible over generally the same</p>

<p>region that the winter storm warning is in place for now as the</p>

<p>shortwave over Northern California this morning races southeast</p>

<p>and helps to drag the the cold upper trough into SETX. Thursday</p>

<p>afternoon the temperatures rise back above freezing over much of</p>

<p>the region and the trace snow amounts should melt before</p>

<p>temperatures tumble again Thursday evening.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the wake of this latest cold front, high pressure will begin</p>

<p>to settle into our region. Skies will clear and light northerly</p>

<p>winds will help cool overnight lows on Thursday back into the</p>

<p>teens for northern counties and the mid-to-upper 20s everywhere</p>

<p>else. On Friday, these mostly clear skies will allow daytime highs</p>

<p>to reach above freezing, with mid-to-upper 40s south of I-10 and</p>

<p>the mid 30s to the north. Overnight, continued northerly flow and</p>

<p>clear sky radiational cooling will allow another night of</p>

<p>below/near freezing temperatures. Areas north of Houston should</p>

<p>drop into the 20s while Houston and areas south will reach near</p>

<p>freezing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>By Saturday, the long awaited warming trend will arrive! Southerly</p>

<p>winds arrive helping to advect warmer and more moist air which</p>

<p>should help to increase cloud cover as well. Daytime highs will</p>

<p>reach the mid-50s and lower 60s on Saturday and mid-to-upper 60s by</p>

<p>Sunday. Overnight lows will also reach above freezing temps for the</p>

<p>first time in several days.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>By late Sunday and early Monday another cold front is expected along</p>

<p>with the return of rain chances, but this front will be mild in</p>

<p>comparison to what we have recently experienced. The ECMWF and</p>

<p>Canadian models show a surface front strengthening and extending</p>

<p>just east of our CWA, so eastern and offshore areas have the highest</p>

<p>chance of rain. The GFS shows a broad swath of rain pushing through</p>

<p>our CWA as the surface front is much stronger and develops to our</p>

<p>northwest and pushes east across our region. There is still plenty</p>

<p>of time for these global models to come to a consensus, but for now,</p>

<p>expect rain chances to return late Sunday through early Monday with</p>

<p>slightly cooler temperatures behind it. In the wake of</p>

<p>Sunday/Monday&#39;s front, overnight lows will still remain above</p>

<p>freezing and daytime highs will be in the mid-50s to lower 60s.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally towards the end of the forecast period, the GFS and Canadian</p>

<p>are indicating a shortwave 500mb trough developing in SW CONUS and</p>

<p>the Baja peninsula and a vertically stacked low developing beneath</p>

<p>it at the surface, whereas the ECMWF is not picking up on this</p>

<p>system at all. Should this shortwave trough push through quickly</p>

<p>like the GFS is suggesting, there could be another round of rain</p>

<p>chances late Tuesday/early Wednesday, but global models are in</p>

<p>disagreement overall and there will be time to hone this forecast</p>

<p>further over the next few days. KBL</p>

<p>.UPDATE...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Low pressure over the western Gulf will move E-NE and pull away</p>

<p>from the region. A mixture of rain, freezing and rain and sleet</p>

<p>will diminish and end this afternoon. But the damage has been done</p>

<p>with icy roads and power lines/trees becoming glazed over. Icy</p>

<p>conditions expected to persist this afternoon despite rain</p>

<p>diminishing. Will leave the Winter Storm Warning as previously</p>

<p>configured as sub-freezing temperatures expected to redevelop</p>

<p>tonight and residual wet spots could become icy spots. Have</p>

<p>lowered MaxT values for this afternoon. No other changes. 43</p>

<p>301 PM CST Wed Feb 17 2021</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>.SHORT TERM...(Tonight through Thursday Night)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Low pressure over the western Gulf has moved east and colder air</p>

<p>will funnel into SE TX in the wake of the low. Colder temperatures</p>

<p>will continue to surge back into SE TX tonight and only persistent</p>

<p>cloud cover will mitigate a stronger temperature fall. That said,</p>

<p>MinT values will likely bottom out in the mid 20&#39;s far NW to</p>

<p>around 30 over the south. Residual water on area roadways will</p>

<p>likely refreeze creating icy conditions on area highways/roads and</p>

<p>drivers should exercise extreme caution if venturing out tonight.</p>

<p>Ice that accumulated on trees and powerlines will not melt and</p>

<p>this could also create some trouble if branches should fall on</p>

<p>structures or take down power lines. Since the heavy icing that</p>

<p>occurred this morning has ended but the risk from residual icing</p>

<p>remains and additional light winter precip is expected later</p>

<p>tonight, feel a Winter Weather Advisory is more applicable than a</p>

<p>Winter Storm Warning in regards to discussing the ice hazard and</p>

<p>possible winter precip.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most of the precipitation has exited the area but weak upper</p>

<p>level troughing remains over the state and a weak disturbance</p>

<p>embedded in the W-SW upper flow will bring additional</p>

<p>precipitation to the region later tonight into early Thursday.</p>

<p>Fcst soundings and thickness values support a mixture of light sleet</p>

<p>and snow changing to all light snow on Thursday morning. Moisture</p>

<p>levels look meager and fcst soundings show a lot of dry air in</p>

<p>the 850-700 mb layer so not expecting much more than a dusting.</p>

<p>That said, there is some fairly strong 850-700 mb frontogenetic</p>

<p>forcing from Columbus to Houston. Sometimes, the forcing is</p>

<p>strong to compensate for a lack of moisture so it&#39;s something</p>

<p>that bears watching. MaxT values won&#39;t warm much on Thursday and</p>

<p>will struggle to reach freezing at KCLL and probably only warm</p>

<p>into the upper 30&#39;s at KIAH and points southward. Could get a peak</p>

<p>of sun late Thursday afternoon as subsidence develops in the wake</p>

<p>of the morning short wave.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Skies will clear Thursday night and temperatures will once again</p>

<p>plunge to very cold values with mid teens likely by sunrise</p>

<p>generally north of a Brenham to Trinity line. Temperatures will</p>

<p>fall into the lower and mid 20&#39;s over the southern half of the</p>

<p>region. A Hard Freeze Watch will be in effect for Thu Night into</p>

<p>early Friday. SE TX will be looking at another 10-16 hours below</p>

<p>freezing and probably 8 to 10 hours below 25 degrees north of the</p>

<p>Brenham-Trinity line. Another Wind Chill Advisory or Warning may</p>

<p>also be required as Wind Chill values are expected to fall into</p>

<p>the single digits north and teens central. 43</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&amp;&amp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>.LONG TERM [Friday through next Wednesday]...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&#39;ll start off with the bad news. Hard freeze conditions return on</p>

<p>Friday morning as surface high pressure settles into the South</p>

<p>Central CONUS and northerlies strengthen, with residents of the</p>

<p>northern counties expected to experience temperatures in the teens</p>

<p>once again as the sun rises while the Houston metro unlikely to</p>

<p>break 30 degrees overnight. As a result, we have issued a Hard</p>

<p>Freeze Watch for all non-coastal counties during this time.</p>

<p>Residents impacted by the current power outage situation should plan</p>

<p>to continue to take protective actions as the subfreezing</p>

<p>temperatures continue. Highs on Friday afternoon will reach the mid</p>

<p>30s to mid 40s, a slight increase over the previous day as a</p>

<p>relaxing surface pressure gradient moderates CAA.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The remainder of the long-term forecast period brings some better</p>

<p>news. One more night of subfreezing temperatures will arrive on</p>

<p>Friday evening, with lows once again dipping into the upper teens to</p>

<p>20s at most locations as clearing promotes more efficient nocturnal</p>

<p>cooling. However, by Saturday, an eastward shift of surface high</p>

<p>pressure will bring about a long-awaited return to an onshore flow</p>

<p>pattern which will gradually work to increase temperatures and dew</p>

<p>points through the weekend. Most locations finally see the 50s on</p>

<p>Saturday and subfreezing overnight lows finally cease. More</p>

<p>seasonable, but still below average temperatures return on Sunday as</p>

<p>continued WAA allows for highs in the upper 50s to low 60s.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A developing lee cyclone will push into the Great Lakes region as</p>

<p>troughing becomes dominant over the Central CONUS by early Monday,</p>

<p>and a surface cold front extending from this feature will approach</p>

<p>SE Texas. Fortunately, the passage of this feature looks to be</p>

<p>relatively uneventful. The main question continues to be the extend</p>

<p>to which scattered showers will accompany the approaching front.</p>

<p>Latest GFS &amp; Canadian solutions indicate more ample moisture return</p>

<p>and as a result more precipitation as the front pushes through the</p>

<p>area by Monday afternoon. The EC remains drier with less</p>

<p>precipitation coverage. Have included slight chance PoPs for most</p>

<p>locations for the time being, but this will likely need adjusting</p>

<p>based on model consensus over the next couple of days.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Temperatures cool a bit with the fropa though am not currently</p>

<p>carrying any subfreezing overnight lows on Monday. Clearer and</p>

<p>gradually warming conditions look to persist through mid week with</p>

<p>highs on Wednesday breaking back into the 70s.</p>

<p>439 AM CST Thu Feb 18 2021</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>.SHORT TERM [Today Through Friday Afternoon]...</p>

<p>Cold start this morning with temperatures down in the 25-33 degree</p>

<p>range with northerly winds 5-15 mph inland and 15-20 near the</p>

<p>coast. Wind chills this morning over the northern sections of the</p>

<p>area will warrant a short wind chill advisory with them dipping</p>

<p>into the 10-14 degree range. Winter weather advisory continues</p>

<p>through 6 pm for the northern counties where some very light</p>

<p>snow/sleet will be possible as the upper jet increases this</p>

<p>morning then the pulls away to the east this afternoon. So far</p>

<p>although the radar reflectivities look somewhat impressive these</p>

<p>are highlighting the snow around 10000-12000 ft that is falling</p>

<p>into a dry and warmer layer melting and leaving little if any that</p>

<p>is making it through the layer. As the jet increase and some</p>

<p>slightly increased forcing occurs around 800-600mb with the layer</p>

<p>becoming more moist some of the snow falling into the layer should</p>

<p>survive to reach the ground as a mix of snow/sleet/graupel.</p>

<p>Accumulations should be very light. Lift wanes quickly around 3 or</p>

<p>4 pm over the west and east by 6 pm. Cloud cover should persist</p>

<p>throughout the day hampering the temperature rises as the CAA</p>

<p>continues across the region in the wake of the latest cold front.</p>

<p>Temperatures only rise 2-5 degrees today from where there are at</p>

<p>this point early this morning. The column dries out quickly</p>

<p>tonight and skies clear from west to east and a colder night will</p>

<p>be on tap. Hard freeze looks likely again for areas generally</p>

<p>north of the 59 corridor. Lows of 15-25 degrees will be common</p>

<p>place and even Galveston island is likely to see another night of</p>

<p>freezing. Icy roads that potentially thaw out but don&#39;t dry off</p>

<p>will become icy again in the evenings. Friday though will be an</p>

<p>improvement with temperatures rising above freezing areawide!</p>

<p>Coastal areas in the mid 40s...central upper 30s to mid 40s and</p>

<p>the northernmost counties 35-38. This will help melt much of the</p>

<p>lingering ice over the area...some of the more hard hit areas with</p>

<p>icing over the north will still have some left to deal with</p>

<p>though. Speaking of melting ice...that makes for an usual hazard</p>

<p>in SETX that of falling ice. Please be aware of your</p>

<p>surroundings...don&#39;t linger beneath any these potentially</p>

<p>dangerous chunks of ice that may fall. Areas that remain in the</p>

<p>shade or sheltered from drying and remain wet late this afternoon</p>

<p>and again Friday will be good candidates for slippery icy</p>

<p>locations so use caution when venturing out on the front/back</p>

<p>landings and sidewalks that maybe sheltered by trees. Much warmer</p>

<p>weather is headed this way this weekend! 45</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&amp;&amp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>.LONG TERM [Friday Night through Thursday]...</p>

<p>Somewhat good news Friday evening as it is the last night for below</p>

<p>freezing conditions across our CWA. Temperatures north of Conroe</p>

<p>will drop into the teens and low 20s. Meanwhile, temperatures south</p>

<p>of Conroe towards Houston will be in the mid-to-upper 20s while</p>

<p>southern and coastal regions will be near freezing. By Saturday,</p>

<p>daytime highs will range from the upper-40s for our northern</p>

<p>counties to the mid-50s for our southern and coastal counties. As</p>

<p>southerly winds return Saturday, warmer and higher PWAT air will</p>

<p>help drive temperatures up during the day and overnight. The</p>

<p>increased cloud cover overnight from this onshore wind will also</p>

<p>prevent heat from radiating out at night and keep temperatures mild</p>

<p>and above freezing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our next round of rain chances return on late Sunday through Monday</p>

<p>as a mid-latitude cyclone develops over Eastern CONUS. The sfc low</p>

<p>will be centered near The Great Lakes region, but its associated</p>

<p>surface cold front is expected to stretch, develop, and strengthen</p>

<p>over our region before pushing east and out of our CWA. Fortunately,</p>

<p>this cold front will be mild in comparison to our most recent arctic</p>

<p>fronts. In the wake of this next front, daytime highs will still be</p>

<p>in the 50s on Monday and overnight lows will be above freezing for</p>

<p>most areas and near freezing for far northern, Houston County.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>By mid-week next week, it&#39;ll be time to break out some flip-flops</p>

<p>again as temperatures are expected climb back into the 70s. Global</p>

<p>models are hinting at another surface low developing somewhere over</p>

<p>North Texas or Oklahoma and a surface front pushing through SE</p>

<p>Texas, towards late Wednesday/Early Thursday, bringing our next</p>

<p>round of rain chances.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Snow flurries developed across the northern half of the area today</p>

<p>and these will end as drier air moves into the region from the NW.</p>

<p>With the drier air, skies will also begin to clear and once skies</p>

<p>clear and winds decouple, temperatures are going to take a tumble.</p>

<p>High pressure will build into West Texas and drift toward</p>

<p>east Texas toward morning. The cold air mass associated with the</p>

<p>high will once again settle over SE TX with MiNT values falling into</p>

<p>the teens over the north, low/mid 20&#39;s central and south and low</p>

<p>30&#39;s along the coast. A Hard Freeze Warning will remain in effect</p>

<p>tonight for most of SE TX with 6 to 8 hours of temperatures at or</p>

<p>below 25 degrees. A Wind Chill Advisory has also been issued</p>

<p>over the NW-W zones with WC values falling into the single digits</p>

<p>later tonight.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Friday will trend slightly warmer, or maybe it&#39;ll just feel a bit</p>

<p>better with sunny skies and less wind. Surface high pressure will</p>

<p>settle directly over SE TX by Fri afternoon with MaxT values ranging</p>

<p>from the mid 30&#39;s far NW zones to the mid 40&#39;s far southern zones</p>

<p>and coast.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another night of very cold temperatures is expected Fri Night into</p>

<p>Sat morning as the surface high drifts east. Clear skies, light</p>

<p>winds and dry air will allow ideal radiational cooling to commence</p>

<p>and produce MinT values near 20 degrees far NW zones and mid/upper</p>

<p>20&#39;s elsewhere. A Hard freeze Watch is in effect for the NW zones</p>

<p>for tomorrow night.&nbsp; 43</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>.LONG TERM [Saturday Through Thursday]...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In what will be a welcomed change for SE TX, a warming trend is</p>

<p>expected heading into the weekend with an end to subfreezing</p>

<p>temperatures now in sight. As high pressure departs eastward and a</p>

<p>return to onshore winds allows for enhanced WAA, we should finally</p>

<p>break into the 50s on Saturday. While lows overnight will remain</p>

<p>below normal, it&#39;ll be the first time in quite a while where no</p>

<p>subfreezing temperatures are anticipated across the entirety of SE</p>

<p>TX. The warming trend continues on Sunday with temperatures</p>

<p>pushing closer to near-seasonable values- the upper 50s across the</p>

<p>northern counties and low to mid 60s along the coast and in the</p>

<p>Houston metro.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The approach of a surface cold front on Sunday night/early Monday</p>

<p>morning will bring a slight cool-down to the area, though the</p>

<p>magnitude of this boundary passage will not come close to</p>

<p>approaching what we have seen over the past several days. Lows on</p>

<p>Sunday night dip back into the 30s/40s, though I have continued</p>

<p>not to carry any subfreezing temperatures in the forecast (though</p>

<p>CLL and surrounding areas will get close). Global models remain</p>

<p>bearish regarding the possibility of showers to encounter the</p>

<p>front, with the NAM/EC/GFS all indicating marginal QPF. Have</p>

<p>maintained slight chance PoPs as a result.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>High pressure briefly enters the picture on Monday with offshore</p>

<p>winds providing CAA and allowing for daytime highs to return to</p>

<p>the 50s. However, this surface feature should depart quickly and a</p>

<p>return to southerlies can be expected on Tuesday afternoon.</p>

<p>Warming will continue into mid week with most locations seeing the</p>

<p>70s by Wednesday. A deepening lee cyclone may drag our next cold</p>

<p>front into SE TX on Thursday, though the timing of this feature</p>

<p>and magnitude of any associated precipitation looks more uncertain</p>

<p>for the time being.</p>

<p>.SHORT TERM [Today Through Saturday Afternoon]...</p>

<p>Clear skies across the region this morning with north winds 5-10</p>

<p>mph inland and cold. Temperatures were 23 to 33 across the area</p>

<p>and wind chills of 14-22 were common. With the clear skies and</p>

<p>winds slowly relaxing inland expecting the temps to slowly fall a</p>

<p>few more degrees. Hard freeze warning and wind chill advisory</p>

<p>already verifying over the northern half of the area. Temperatures</p>

<p>will rise today up into the upper 30s to mid 40s even with the</p>

<p>northerly winds. Upper trough over the area departs to the east</p>

<p>and high pressure at the surface slides overhead by tonight. Clear</p>

<p>skies and dry column with winds decoupling should set the stage</p>

<p>for one more cold night. Hard freeze warning for the northern 1/2</p>

<p>of the area with temperatures falling into the low 20s. The</p>

<p>southern half is somewhat more challenging with lows of</p>

<p>26-34...and the coast currently forecasting 40 for Galveston but</p>

<p>if the winds relax enough then veer to the east or east southeast</p>

<p>before sunrise the then temperatures on the coast may actually</p>

<p>rise before sunrise and the forecast could be too cold. Saturday</p>

<p>the high moves into Louisiana and east and southeast winds return</p>

<p>to the region which will boost temperatures solidly into the 50s</p>

<p>areawide and wouldn&#39;t rule out some low 60s in the southwestern</p>

<p>counties. Should also begin to see some scattered clouds spread</p>

<p>.LONG TERM...[Saturday Night Through Friday]...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the first time in forever, we&#39;re expecting low temperatures on</p>

<p>Saturday night to be ABOVE freezing! This is a welcome change after</p>

<p>such an extended period of frigid temperatures. Low temperatures</p>

<p>will dip into the upper 30s in our far northern counties, the 40s</p>

<p>further to the south (including Houston metro area), and 50s along</p>

<p>the coast thanks to surface high pressure moving off to the east.</p>

<p>The onshore flow continues into Sunday where we&#39;ll see temperatures</p>

<p>top out in the 60s for most locations. On Sunday night/Monday</p>

<p>morning, a weak cold front will pass through the area. This will not</p>

<p>bring a significant cool down like we had earlier this week, but it</p>

<p>will drop temperatures back down into the mid 30s/40s for Sunday</p>

<p>night. Rain showers will likely be along the boundary of this front,</p>

<p>but these will be light and short-lived. PWATs will be around 0.75&quot;-</p>

<p>1.0&quot; and favorable jet mechanics will be in place with divergence</p>

<p>aloft, but there will be a pretty sizable subsidence inversion</p>

<p>around 850 mb that will keep the bulk of the moisture from</p>

<p>extending vertically.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>High pressure builds in behind this front as well but quickly pushes</p>

<p>off to the east and places us in an upward trend for temperatures</p>

<p>after Monday night. High temperatures will go from the upper 50s/low</p>

<p>60s on Monday to the mid-to-upper 60s on Tuesday to the 70s on</p>

<p>Wednesday. Our next cold front comes through on Thursday/Friday, but</p>

<p>uncertainty remains on the timing of FROPA with the GFS pushing the</p>

<p>front through substantially earlier than the ECMWF/Canadian models.</p>

<p>With the extended period of onshore flow in the early half of the</p>

<p>week, PWATs will be a bit higher at 1.00&quot;-1.25&quot; along with increased</p>

<p>Theta-E. Forecast soundings also indicate CAPE values of 700-900</p>

<p>J/kg in our northwestern counties, so have included isolated</p>

<p>thunderstorms in the grids for Thursday afternoon as the front moves</p>

<p>through and acts as the source of lift.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once again, high pressure briefly brings northerly winds to the</p>

<p>region and quickly moves off to the east. This puts the region back</p>

<p>into onshore flow by Friday night/Saturday morning. GFS/ECMWF are in</p>

<p>agreement on a strong jet streak developing over the Southern</p>

<p>Plains, with the ECMWF placing the jet streak over TX/OK while the</p>

<p>GFS places it further north in OK/KS/MO. Have leaned towards the</p>

<p>ECMWF model which places the region in the right entrance region of</p>

<p>the jet streak. Favorable jet mechanics combined with increasing</p>

<p>moisture through the southeasterly winds means that rain chances</p>

<p>will pop back into the forecast for Friday.&nbsp; 26</p>

<p>303 PM CST Fri Feb 19 2021</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>.SHORT TERM...(Tonight through Saturday Night)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although still chilly, conditions have begun to moderate with the</p>

<p>help of abundant sunshine this afternoon. One more night of</p>

<p>freezing temperatures is expected as high pressure settles over SE</p>

<p>TX. Will maintain the Hard Freeze Warning for the N-NW zones but</p>

<p>models have trended a bit warmer for tonight. The rest of SE</p>

<p>Texas will endure a short period of freezing temperatures tonight.</p>

<p>Not real confident with regard to some patchy ground fog that</p>

<p>could develop but the ECMWF, NAM soundings and SREF data support</p>

<p>some freezing fog toward Saturday morning. The T/Td gap narrows</p>

<p>considerably tonight and felt it was best to at least mention some</p>

<p>potential for freezing fog over the northern half of the CWA in</p>

<p>the weather grids.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The surface high will shift east of the region on Saturday with an</p>

<p>onshore flow developing. This will lead to warmer temperatures and</p>

<p>a slight increase in moisture. Should start to see an increase in</p>

<p>clouds by afternoon as the moisture deepens. MaxT values will warm</p>

<p>into the upper 50&#39;s central and south and we have not been that</p>

<p>warm since February 10th. The northern zones will probably remain</p>

<p>in the 40&#39;s. Warm air advection will persist into Saturday night</p>

<p>and low temperatures will probably occur in the evening and either</p>

<p>hold steady or slowly rise as onshore winds continue to draw low</p>

<p>level moisture into the area. The WAA pattern will allow for</p>

<p>patchy fog and perhaps some drizzle late Saturday night. 43</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&amp;&amp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>.LONG TERM [Sunday Through Friday]...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some long-awaited warmth finally arrives on Sunday, when the return</p>

<p>of onshore flow should continue to promote WAA and push highs into</p>

<p>the 60s across the majority of SE TX. As a deepening surface low</p>

<p>approaches the great plains region, a cold front extending from this</p>

<p>feature will push through the central CONUS during the day on Sunday</p>

<p>and approach SE TX on Sunday night. With the boundary pushing</p>

<p>offshore by Monday, along with some isolated showers along and ahead</p>

<p>of it, another cooldown is expected. Fortunately, this will not be</p>

<p>close in magnitude to what we&#39;ve experienced this week. That being</p>

<p>said, northerly winds behind the departing boundary will allow for</p>

<p>enhanced CAA and thus lows in the upper 30s to low 40s are on tap</p>

<p>for Sunday night and into Monday morning.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>High pressure settles into the South Central CONUS following the</p>

<p>departure of the surface cold front, though its presence will be</p>

<p>short lived as its center advances fairly quickly into the central</p>

<p>Gulf by Monday. With onshore flow redeveloping at this time, a warm-</p>

<p>up into mid week will finally give us our first taste of seasonable</p>

<p>weather in quite some time. High temperatures will push into the</p>

<p>mid/upper 60s at most locations on Tuesday and the 70s across much</p>

<p>of the area Wednesday. Increasing cloudiness associated with onshore</p>

<p>Gulf moisture transport will inhibit nocturnal cooling by mid-week,</p>

<p>with lows on Wednesday and Thursday remaining in the upper 40s/low</p>

<p>50s.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our next shot at widespread measurable rainfall (and perhaps some</p>

<p>isolated thunderstorms) looks to arrive on Thursday as our next</p>

<p>surface cold front pushes towards SE TX. Global models still not</p>

<p>fully on board in depicting this event with EC showing a slower</p>

<p>fropa than most recent GFS &amp; Canadian solutions, though each</p>

<p>solution indicates more robust precip coverage/QPF with this</p>

<p>next system.</p>

<p>501 AM CST Sat Feb 20 2021</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>.SHORT TERM [Today Through Sunday Morning]...</p>

<p>High pressure over LA ridging down over SETX this morning. Some</p>

<p>valley fog/freezing fog/low stratus developing in the some of the</p>

<p>northeastern river basins this morning and just to the east that</p>

<p>will expand southwestward this morning. This should dissipate</p>

<p>quickly after sunrise. Hard freeze warning will be allowed to</p>

<p>expire at 9 AM.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A very pleasant day on tap with that high pressure shifting</p>

<p>further away to the northeast pressures falling in the lee of the</p>

<p>Rockies. Flow veers from the east to the southeast and will begin</p>

<p>to increase the low level moisture and bring some modifying air</p>

<p>out of the Gulf (slightly warmer) into the region. Skies should</p>

<p>remain sunny allowing temperatures to climb into the 50s to lower</p>

<p>60s! 5-10 degrees warmer than yesterday. Overnight the high slides</p>

<p>off further to the east and an upper trough swings out over the CO</p>

<p>plains/ and into western NE/KS leading to lower pressures over</p>

<p>Central Plains and increasing the southerly flow and begins to tap</p>

<p>into higher dewpoints. This becomes problematic with the now far</p>

<p>colder SSTs off the Upper Texas Coast. Buoy 42035 was reporting 59</p>

<p>degree sea surface temperatures just 10 days ago and is now</p>

<p>reporting 50 degrees...that is a tremendous cooling of the shelf</p>

<p>water and coastal sites from the PORTS data showing 41-46 degrees</p>

<p>in and around Galveston Bay and a chilly 39-43. With the return</p>

<p>flow expected and dewpoints forecast to increase to lower 50s with</p>

<p>southerly winds and the mixed layer moisture steadily increasing</p>

<p>as well it will be difficult to mix down drier air aloft. Although</p>

<p>the guidance isn&#39;t hitting on yet I would thoroughly expect that</p>

<p>seas fog will commence Sunday morning some where in the 7 to 10 am</p>

<p>window. This will of course play havoc with coastal temperatures</p>

<p>as the fog hinders insolation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>45</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&amp;&amp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>.LONG TERM [Sunday Afternoon Through Saturday]...</p>

<p>Temperatures will top out in the 60s for most locations on Sunday as</p>

<p>onshore flow persists for most of the day. If you missed overnight</p>

<p>lows in the 30s (ha!) then you&#39;re in luck because another cold front</p>

<p>is on the way with FROPA expected on Sunday night/Monday morning.</p>

<p>This will be a weak front and will not bring significantly cooler</p>

<p>air like last week. Low temperatures for Sunday night and Monday</p>

<p>night will be knocked back down to the 30s/40s. Scattered rain</p>

<p>showers will accompany the front due to a combination of PWATs</p>

<p>around 0.75&quot;- 1.00&quot;, a shortwave trough digging into the Southern</p>

<p>Plains, and being located underneath the right entrance region of</p>

<p>a jet streak for divergence aloft. However, not expecting any</p>

<p>heavy rain or thunderstorms due to a subsidence inversion around</p>

<p>800 mb and a lack of instability.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Surface high pressure moves in behind this front but pushes eastward</p>

<p>quickly. This will put us back into onshore flow by Tuesday. You</p>

<p>know what that means....time to go up the Southeast Texas</p>

<p>temperature roller coaster! Temperatures will trend upward through</p>

<p>the early half of the week with highs in the 70s expected by</p>

<p>Wednesday. The climb halts there though as we have another cold</p>

<p>front on the horizon for Thursday. No significant cool down is</p>

<p>expected with this front either. Uncertainty still remains in the</p>

<p>timing of FROPA with the GFS and Canadian models pushing the front</p>

<p>through quite a bit quicker than the ECMWF model. Leaned towards a</p>

<p>Thursday afternoon timeframe for FROPA for now. The models do agree</p>

<p>on rain to be associated with this front as well thanks to a</p>

<p>sustained period of onshore flow steadily increasing PWATs to 1.00&quot;-</p>

<p>1.25&quot;. Instability will be increased as well, so may see some</p>

<p>thunderstorms mixed in during FROPA especially for our northern</p>

<p>counties.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>CAA will not last long following this front either as winds quickly</p>

<p>become onshore again by Friday night. Models indicate that a strong</p>

<p>jet streak will develop over the Southern Plains, but there is still</p>

<p>some uncertainty in its exact placement. This is important because</p>

<p>having upper-level divergence is key to taking advantage of the</p>

<p>increasing moisture from the onshore flow. Current thinking is that</p>

<p>the jet streak will be far south enough to include the region in the</p>

<p>right entrance region. Subsequently, rain chances have been added to</p>

<p>grids at the start of next weekend.</p>

<p>Area Forecast Discussion</p>

<p>National Weather Service Houston/Galveston TX</p>

<p>314 PM CST Sat Feb 20 2021</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>.SHORT TERM [Tonight Through Sunday Night]...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Surface high pressure has moved off to the east allowing for</p>

<p>southerly winds and warmer temperatures to prevail across the</p>

<p>region. Tonight will be the first night in a long while where no one</p>

<p>across the CWA has freezing temps in the overnight forecast. Even</p>

<p>warmer conditions expected tomorrow, though we&#39;ll see some</p>

<p>increasing cloudiness as shallow Gulf moisture continues its return</p>

<p>to the area. The cold snap has caused a significant drop in water</p>

<p>temperatures near the coast (40s-mid 50s) so would anticipate some</p>

<p>sea fog development later in the day and evening Sunday as warmer</p>

<p>air overspreads. The next front should be moving into northern parts</p>

<p>of the region Sunday evening and off the coast by 3am or so. Look</p>

<p>for a specking of -ra as it approaches...probably consolidating into</p>

<p>a thin band of -ra as it approaches the US59 &amp; I-10 corridor</p>

<p>southward. (Nothing of significance &amp; no threat of frozen precip.) 47</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>.LONG TERM [Monday Through Saturday]...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A much welcomed warming trend is expected to take hold through the</p>

<p>middle of the upcoming week in the wake of the departing surface</p>

<p>cold front on Monday. We&#39;ll see a bit of a drop off in high</p>

<p>temperatures (50s to low 60s) and some chillier lows (mid 30s to</p>

<p>lower 40s) come Monday as moderate northerlies behind the</p>

<p>boundary enhance CAA, though an onshore flow regime quickly</p>

<p>redevelops on Tuesday with surface high pressure behind the cold</p>

<p>frontal boundary departing eastward. As a result, conditions will</p>

<p>make a return to near-seasonable values by mid-week, with highs</p>

<p>reaching the mid 60s on Tuesday afternoon and the lower 70s at</p>

<p>most locations on Wednesday. While the increasing onshore winds</p>

<p>should work to also increase cloudiness during this time, we&#39;ll</p>

<p>generally be seeing some of the most pleasant weather for the</p>

<p>region in quite some time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Global models, while still divergent towards the end of the</p>

<p>extended forecast period, have come into a bit better agreement</p>

<p>with the 12Z suite of deterministic solutions. In general, the</p>

<p>arrival of the next surface front looks to be on track for</p>

<p>Wednesday Night into Thursday as a boundary extending from a</p>

<p>deepening low over the Great Lakes region traverses the South</p>

<p>Central CONUS. Moisture return ahead of the boundary&#39;s approach</p>

<p>remains a bit stronger in the EC solution compared to the latest</p>

<p>GFS, however expected QPF values have come into a bit better</p>

<p>agreement with showers developing along and ahead of it. Have</p>

<p>continued to include chance PoPs as GFS fropa remains a touch</p>

<p>faster than the EC and Canadian fropa is much faster.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the boundary reaches the coastal waters, it looks likely to</p>

<p>stall offshore before pushing back northward as a surface warm</p>

<p>front. Precipitation chances look to return headed into the</p>

<p>weekend as this occurs, aided by favorable upper jet dynamics.</p>

<p>Amounts and intensity of this precip event remain uncertain for</p>

<p>the time being, but early consensus seems to suggest a wet weekend</p>

<p>ahead next week.</p>
