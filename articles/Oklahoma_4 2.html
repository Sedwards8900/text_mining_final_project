<p align="left"><strong>Note:</strong> This paper was originally written in 1994 as NOAA Technical Memorandum NWS SR-160. This version was last updated in March 2023&nbsp;to update the OKC area tornado track map with data through the end of 2022. <!-- The tornado table has been updated with information from the <a class="textlink" href="/media/oun/stormdata/oun202110.pdf" target="_blank">October&nbsp;2021</a> edition of Storm Data, and preliminary data from the <a class="textlink" href="/oun/tornadodata-ok-2021" target="_blank">2021 tornado table</a> for Oklahoma.</p> --></p>

<h2 class="section">1. Introduction</h2>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<p align="left">Oklahoma City (OKC), by virtue of its large areal extent and location near the heart of &quot;tornado alley,&quot; has earned a reputation over the years as one of the more tornado-prone cities in the United States. In the 1960s and 1970s, news and magazine articles sometimes quoted the number of times OKC has been struck by tornadoes; that number typically was in the 30s or lower 40s, depending on the year of publication. The source of the number most likely was a local listing, kept on station at the National Weather Service Forecast Office (WSFO OKC). That list included 43 tornadoes as of 1978. Sometime later, record keeping ceased for some reason and the existing list was relegated to a binder that was lost among the growing masses of other records that accumulated at the office.</p>

<p align="left">In 1991, a project was initiated to revise the list by adding recent tornadoes (since 1978), validating existing entries, and searching for any others that might have been overlooked. This turned out to be a formidable task, for several reasons. One was the lack of reliable sources for events that occurred before 1950. The only readily- available data source prior to 1950, other than the local records on station at WSFO OKC, was Grazulis (1990). The compilation by Grazulis includes all tornadoes of F2 intensity or greater, and all killer tornadoes, from 1880 through 1989. Thus there are no records on weak tornadoes prior to 1950 (unless they happened to make it into the WSFO listing), and so the true number of tornadoes probably is much higher than the total arrived at herein. After 1950, records were cross-checked using <strong>Storm Data</strong> and the <a class="textlink" href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/wcm/" target="_blank">severe weather database</a> compiled at the <a class="textlink" href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/" target="_blank">Storm Prediction Center</a> (SPC).</p>

<p align="left">A second obstacle arose in determining exactly where the OKC city limits are - or were. OKC covers a large area today, but the city limits have changed over the years such that some areas that are now part of OKC were not always within the city limits. Peripheral townships have emerged as well over the years, some of which are now wholly surrounded by OKC city land. In order to establish a consistent area, it was decided to include the present OKC limits and all other surrounding cities and towns that are contained largely or wholly within those limits. The resulting area (<a class="textlink" href="/images/oun/tornadodata/okctor-figure1.png" onclick="window.open(this.href,'OKCTORFIG1','resizable=yes,location=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=no,status=no,toolbar=no,fullscreen=no,dependent=no,width=803,height=536,status'); return false">Figure 1</a>, hereafter called the &quot;immediate OKC area&quot;) includes roughly 600 square miles. All recorded tornado events occurring wholly or partly within this area are included in the list. In addition to OKC, the following jurisdictions are included: Bethany, Choctaw, Crutcho, Del City, Forest Park, Jones, Midwest City, Moore, Mustang, Nichols Hills, Nicoma Park, Valley Brook, the Village, Warr Acres, Witcher, and Yukon (<a class="textlink" href="/images/oun/tornadodata/okctor-figure1.png" onclick="window.open(this.href,'OKCTORFIG1','resizable=yes,location=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=no,status=no,toolbar=no,fullscreen=no,dependent=no,width=803,height=536,status'); return false">Figure 1</a>). The cities of Edmond, El Reno, and Norman are not included, which means that tornadoes striking within their city limits are not listed unless they also affected the immediate OKC area.</p>

<p align="left">Each of the 171 tornado listings (see the OKC Tornado Table Tab) contains the date and time of initial touchdown (note that all times are CST) or a total time range (if available), maximum tornado path width and length, maximum F Scale or EF Scale rating (see the Appendix Tab for descriptions of the F Scale and EF Scale), number of people killed and injured (from the entire event), counties included in the path, and a brief description of the path. A narrative describing what is known about the event follows the other data.&nbsp; A dollar estimate of damage (if available and not adjusted for inflation) and the data sources used for each tornado entry are included at the end of each narrative.</p>

<p align="left">Many of the events were found in more than one data source. In general the multiple sources were in good agreement. However, there were occasional differences, especially with F-scale ratings. The extensive research conducted by Grazulis (1990) suggests his ratings to be the most reliable, and they have been used when the ratings differed among the available sources. Since Grazulis lists only events of F2 intensity or greater, any event not found in his listing has been given a rating of either F0 or F1. Events listed as F2 in the SPC database, but not appearing in Grazulis 1990, are listed here as F1. Notes are included in the narrative of an event if differences were found in the F-scale ratings among the available sources. Weak events (F0 and F1) before 1950 had no assigned F scale in any of the available sources, and thus have been assigned an estimated rating based on the available data.</p>

<h2 class="section">2. Statistics</h2>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<p align="left">May is the peak month for all tornadoes, followed closely by April and June (<a class="textlink" href="/images/oun/tornadodata/okctor-figure2.png" onclick="window.open(this.href,'OKCTORFIG2','resizable=yes,location=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=no,status=no,toolbar=no,fullscreen=no,dependent=no,width=1259,height=1020,status'); return false">Figure 2</a>). About two thirds of all tornadoes in OKC have struck during those three months. Strong and violent tornadoes tend to occur slightly earlier, with April the peak month. Note that 18 of the 27 April tornadoes were F2 or greater, and that 5 of the 12 F4/F5 tornadoes on record occurred in April. However, since 1999, 5 of the violent tornadoes have occurred during the month of May. Frequencies level off during the summer and autumn before dwindling during the winter. (December and January are the only two months in which the immediate OKC area has not been struck.)</p>

<p align="left">Tornadoes striking OKC have formed most frequently between mid-afternoon and early evening (2 to 7PM CST, or 3 to 8 PM CDT; see <a class="textlink" href="/images/oun/tornadodata/okctor-figure3.png" onclick="window.open(this.href,'OKCTORFIG3','resizable=yes,location=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=no,status=no,toolbar=no,fullscreen=no,dependent=no,width=1254,height=1080,status'); return false">Figure 3</a>). The period of peak activity also appears in the distribution of strong (F2/F3) and violent (F4/F5) tornadoes, and the peak of F2 or greater tornadoes appears to occur as a broad peak centered around 4 PM CST/5 PM CDT. Other notable findings include a general lack of early morning events (only one between 5 and 7 AM CST), a prevalence of weak events during the late morning and midday hours (with one notable exception), and a rapid increase in frequency during the early afternoon (1 to 2 PM CST, or 2 to 3 PM CDT).</p>

<p align="left"><span color="#CC0000">Note:</span> The time distribution in <a class="textlink" href="/images/oun/tornadodata/okctor-figure3.png" onclick="window.open(this.href,'OKCTORFIG3','resizable=yes,location=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=no,status=no,toolbar=no,fullscreen=no,dependent=no,width=1254,height=1080,status'); return false">Figure 3</a> is based on tornado start time, which may be up to an hour or so earlier than the actual &quot;strike time&quot; in OKC in the case of long-track, long-lived tornadoes. For example, the F5 tornado of 3 May 1999 began around 6:26 PM CDT (5:26 PM CST), but entered the OKC city limits around 7:12 PM CDT, and lifted in Midwest City around 7:48 PM CDT. Since such events constitute only a small fraction of the total, the difference is not considered to be significant.</p>

<p align="left">Tornado distribution by decade (<a class="textlink" href="/images/oun/tornadodata/okctor-figure4.png" onclick="window.open(this.href,'OKCTORFIG4','resizable=yes,location=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=no,status=no,toolbar=no,fullscreen=no,dependent=no,width=1264,height=1020,status'); return false">Figure 4</a>) is largely a reflection of the data sources used. The relatively small number of tornadoes through the 1930s is dominated by strong and violent events (F2 or greater), while the increase in frequency in the 1950s, 60s, and 70s is due mainly to a larger number of weak (F0 and F1) events. The frequency of weak events almost certainly has been more constant than the data indicate, but most of the weak events before 1950 probably were not documented.</p>

<p align="left">The decrease in frequency from the 1960s/70s through the 1980s/90s may be due to changes in quality control of severe weather reports. (Note: Eleven of the 15 tornadoes of the 1990s occurred on only 3 dates: 13 June 1998, 4 October 1998, and 3 May 1999.) More attention was placed on downbursts (Fujita 1985), resulting in closer inspection of wind damage and an increasing number of events being classified as straight-line (downburst) winds instead of tornadoes. If this is the case, then some of the reported tornadoes in earlier years may actually have been downbursts, and the decrease in frequency in the 1980s may actually reflect an adjustment toward more representative numbers (i.e. the totals from the 1960s and 70s may be too high).</p>

<p align="left"><a class="textlink" href="/images/oun/tornadodata/okctor-figure5.png" onclick="window.open(this.href, 'OKCTORFIG5', 'resizable=yes,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,fullscreen=no,scrollbars=no,dependent=no,width=1063,height=688'); return false;">Figure 5</a> shows the <em>approximate</em> locations and tracks of the tornadoes listed. Exact tracks are difficult to plot in many cases, especially the early ones, since the available data do not provide enough detail. (Also, many of the referenced landmarks no longer exist). Tracks of tornadoes prior to about 1970 are drawn subjectively from the information available, and may be accurate only within a few miles. This level of accuracy is still enough to reveal a slightly higher concentration of events on the south side of OKC. This trend is especially evident in F2/F3 tornadoes (shown in blue). Although several tornado &quot;corridors&quot; are suggested, it is likely that these distributions are no more than statistical fluctuations. Therefore, past tornado frequencies in a given location do not imply similar frequencies in the future.</p>

<p align="left">Most of the tornadoes moved northeast, while a few moved east or east-southeast. Only one long-track event showed no eastward component of motion; it traveled north to north-northwest through the center of Oklahoma County and the eastern parts of OKC. Speeds, based on available reports, generally ranged from 15 to 40 mph. However, several events (especially weaker ones) displayed slow and erratic movement, and a few were nearly stationary during their short durations.</p>

<p align="left">Some other interesting facts about OKC tornadoes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The F5 tornado that struck the OKC metro area on May 3,1999 was the deadliest (36 killed), second costliest ($1 billion in damage), and the first and only F5 tornado on record in the immediate OKC area.</li>
	<br />
	<li>The EF5 tornado that devastated the OKC metro area on May 20, 2013 was the fourth deadliest (24 killed), costliest ($2 billion in damage), and the first EF5 tornado on record in the immediate OKC area. The Enhanced Fujita Scale rating system was adopted by the National Weather Service in 2007.</li>
	<br />
	<li>The second deadliest tornado occurred on June 12, 1942 (35 killed) and the third deadliest tornado occurred on April 25, 1893 (31 killed).</li>
	<br />
	<li>The third costliest tornado <a class="textlink" href="/images/oun/tornadodata/okctor-figure1.png" onclick="window.open(this.href,'OKCTORFIG1','resizable=yes,location=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=no,status=no,toolbar=no,fullscreen=no,dependent=no,width=803,height=536,status'); return false"><em>(in the immediate OKC area)</em></a> occurred on March 20, 1948, with damage over $10 million mostly to aircraft at Tinker Air Force Base. The May 20, 2013 tornado thus produced roughly 200 times more damage than any May 20, 1948 tornado while the May 3, 1999 F5 tornado produced roughly 100 times more damage than its 1948 counterpart. (This ratio actually is considerably lower if inflation is taken into account. But even with inflation, the May 20, 2013 tornado followed by the May 3, 1999 tornado were the most costly by well over an order of magnitude with respect to the rest the documented OKC tornadoes.)</li>
	<br />
	<li>Thirteen violent tornadoes (eleven F4/EF4 and two F5/EF5) have struck the immediate OKC area. The most recent was on May 20, 2013.</li>
	<br />
	<li>The record for tornadoes in a single day is 5, which occurred during tornado outbreaks on June 8, 1974,&nbsp;May 31, 2013, and October 9, 2018.</li>

Formed 1/4 mile SW of Bryant and Hefner Roads and moved NE, crossing I-35 at the north end of the Frontier City amusement park. It continued ENE close to 122nd Street, and dissipated at 723 PM (823 PM CDT) about 1/4 mile NE of I-44 and Douglas Blvd. All 17 injuries were minor, and occurred at Frontier City. Several businesses, including Frontier City, suffered major structural damage along I-35, from near 122nd south for about 3/4 mile. Damage at Frontier City was confined mainly to the north parking lot, where numerous vehicles were damaged. A 2-story brick building on the NE corner of the park suffered partial failure of the external walls, and the entire roof was removed.</p>

			<p class="tornado">Damage elsewhere in the park was mainly due to strong inflow into the tornado. On the E side of I-35, A truck stop was severely damaged and a portable building containing a CB radio shop was swept away completely. Numerous homes in the Nottingham and Quail Ridge Run subdivisions, 1 to 2 miles E of I-35 along 122nd Street, suffered major or nearly complete roof failure, although most exterior walls remained intact. The tornado approached F3 intensity in these areas. Trees were damaged severely along much of the damage path.</p>

			<p class="tornado">This violent, long-lived tornado was the most infamous of nearly 60 tornadoes that struck central Oklahoma during an unprecedented outbreak on this Monday afternoon and evening. It formed around 626 PM CDT about 2 miles SSW of Amber, and grew rapidly to monstrous proportions as it headed NE, paralleling I-44. It moved across Bridge Creek and rural parts of NW Newcastle, causing continuous F4 and sporadic F5 damage. The tornado was estimated to be a mile in diameter in this area. It weakened to F2/F3 intensity and narrowed to less than 1/4 mile in width as it crossed I-44 and the Canadian River NE of Newcastle and entered far south OKC SW of 149th and May Ave. around 712 PM CDT.</p>

			<p class="tornado">However, it regained F4/F5 intensity and widened again to 1/2 to occasionally 3/4 mile as it moved NE across south OKC, entering Moore just W and N of 12th and Santa Fe. Still moving NE and still producing F4 and occasional F5 damage, it crossed I-35 at the Shields Blvd. junction and moved into NE Moore, at which point it weakened slightly to F3/sporadic F4 intensity and began a gradual turn to the left. This turn took the tornado more to the NNE as it crossed I-240 between Bryant Ave. and Sunnylane Rd.</p>

			<p class="tornado">It crossed SE OKC and entered Del City as an F4 tornado, width 1/3 to 1/2 mile, along SE 44th between Sunnylane and Sooner Rds, and continued NNE to the NW part of Tinker Air force Base, near SE 29th and Sooner Rd. Continuing to turn slowly, it moved almost due N but maintained F4 intensity as it crossed I-40 just E of Sooner Rd. and continued N to between SE 15th and Reno Ave. The tornado then weakened rapidly to F0/F1 intensity as it crossed Reno Ave., and at 748 PM CDT dissipated about 3 blocks N of Reno between Sooner Rd. and Air Depot Blvd.</p>

			<p class="tornado">Totals from this tornado include 36 direct fatalities (12 in Bridge Creek, 1 in Newcastle, 9 in S/SE Oklahoma City, 5 in Moore, 6 in Del City, and 3 in Midwest City), 5 indirect fatalities during or shortly after the tornado, 583 direct injuries, numerous indirect injuries (too many to count), 1800 homes destroyed, and 2500 homes damaged.</p>

			<p class="tornado">The violent Newcastle-South OKC-Moore tornado was first observed developing in McClain County about one-half mile south of OK State Highway 37 in northwest Newcastle to the east of Rockwell Avenue. EF4 damage was observed soon after the tornado crossed OK State Highway 37. The tornado continued to expand in size as it approached the Canadian River and the Cleveland County line.</p>

			<p class="tornado">The tornado moved moved northeast across the Canadian River into Cleveland County near U.S. Interstate Highway 44. The tornado then turned more east and then east-northeast after crossing I-44. Violent EF4 damage was again observed as it began to move into progressively higher density residental areas approaching May Avenue.</p>

			<p class="tornado">The center of the large tornado path passed near SW 149th Street and Western Avenue. After crossing Western Avenue, numerous buildings were destroyed and horses killed at Orr Family Farm. Two storage tanks estimated to weigh approximately 10 tons were lifted from Orr Family Farm and landed about one-half mile east. Moving east, the tornado destroyed much of Briarwood Elementary School, where the NWS storm survey team rated damage as EF5. Despite the destruction of this elementary school during school hours, no fatalities occurred at the school.</p>

			<p class="tornado">As the tornado continued to move east and east-northeast, it moved through much more densely populated suburban neighborhoods of southwest Oklahoma City and Moore where violent destruction was widespread. The width of EF4 and greater damage was up to 250 yards wide as the tornado moved through neighborhoods east of Western Avenue. The first two fatalities occurred in a house in the neighborhood just east of Briarwood Elementary, with another fatality in a house as the tornado approached Santa Fe Avenue.</p>

			<p class="tornado">After crossing Santa Fe Avenue, the tornado moved through more suburban neighborhoods and toward Plaza Towers Elementary School. Damage to the school was extensive and seven children were killed when a wall collapsed at the school. Nine other people were killed in eight different neighborhood homes within one-quarter mile of Plaza Towers Elementary, most occurring just south of the school.</p>

			<p class="tornado">The tornado turned northeast as it approached Telephone Road, made a loop near the intersection of Telephone Road and 4th Street, then moved southeast crossing the interstate. Three people were killed when a convenience store along Telephone Road was destroyed. Crossing Telephone Road, the tornado inflicted significant damage to the Moore Medical Center, a post office and numerous businesses along Telephone Road and U.S. Interstate Highway 35.</p>

			<p class="tornado">Although the tornado was more narrow after crossing I-35, it continued to produce EF4 damage in neighborhoods east of the interstate as it curved east and then again east-northeast. One fatality occurred at a business just east of the interstate, and one final fatality occurred in a home between Eastern Avenue and Bryant Avenue. Consistent EF4 damage continued until the tornado passed SE 4th Street just east of Bryant Avenue.</p>

			<p class="tornado">Moving east from Bryant Avenue, the tornado continued to produce EF2 damage with isolated EF4 damage noted. The density of housing also decreased east of Bryant Avenue as the tornado moved east and east-northeast before dissipating east of Air Depot Blvd. between SE 119th Street and SE 134th Street in southeast Oklahoma City.</p>

When tornado-related damage is surveyed, it is compared to a list of Damage Indicators (DIs) and Degrees of Damage (DoD) which help estimate better the range of wind speeds the tornado likely produced. From that, a rating (from EF0 to EF5) is assigned.</p>

<p align="left">The EF Scale was revised from the <a class="textlink" href="#fujitascale">original Fujita Scale</a> to reflect better examinations of tornado damage surveys so as to align wind speeds more closely with associated storm damage.

<p align="left"><strong>*** IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT EF SCALE WINDS</strong>: The EF scale still is a set of wind estimates (not measurements) based on damage. Its uses three-second gusts estimated at the point of damage based on a judgment of 8 levels of damage to the 28 indicators listed below. These estimates vary with height and exposure. Important: The 3 second gust is not the same wind as in standard surface observations. Standard measurements are taken by weather stations in open exposures, using a directly measured, &quot;one minute mile&quot; speed.</p>

<h2 align="left" class="section">Assigning a Tornado Rating Using the EF Scale</h2>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<p align="left">The NWS is the only federal agency with authority to provide &#39;official&#39; tornado EF Scale ratings. The goal is assign an EF Scale category based on the highest wind speed that occurred within the damage path. First, trained NWS personnel will identify the appropriate damage indicator (DI) [see list below] from more than one of the 28 used in rating the damage. The construction or description of a building should match the DI being considered, and the observed damage should match one of the 8 degrees of damage (DOD) used by the scale. The tornado evaluator will then make a judgment within the range of upper and lower bound wind speeds, as to whether the wind speed to cause the damage is higher or lower than the expected value for the particular DOD. This is done for several structures not just one, before a final EF rating is determined.</p>
