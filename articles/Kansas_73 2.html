heat has barged its way back into the region. Highs across the board Tuesday afternoon made it into the middle to upper 90s. This is going to be the common theme through the end of the week and beyond. Because of the high heat and high humidity, Heat Advisories are in place through 9 p.m. Friday. Dangerous heat index values at or above 105 degrees are likely. Nighttime temperatures in the upper 70s and lower 80s will not offer much relief. We’ll likely shave a few degrees off for the weekend, but we’re still expecting above average temperatures in the lower to middle 90s through next Thursday. There is a glimpse of relief on the horizon, with temperatures potentially dropping back into the middle to upper 80s late next week. On top of that, no major rain chances are on the horizon. However, we cannot rule out a brief shower or thunderstorm in the heat of the day. That would be due to a few weak boundaries moving through from time to time. The next small chance for a shower or storm comes Thursday afternoon. No severe weather expected."}],"credits":{"by":[{"_id":"alena-lee","type":"author","version":"0.5.8","name":"Alena

Lee was born and raised in Las Vegas, NV.\n\nUnlike most weather geeks, her passion for weather didn't stem as a child. Instead it happened while she was finishing up her journalism degree at Arizona State University.\n\nDuring her last semester at ASU she forecast for Cronkite News, an emmy-award winning nightly newscast fully run by students. With her self-taught knowledge of weather it was just enough to land her first job on-air at WPDE in Myrtle Beach, SC.\n\nAfter a two-year stint in the Southeast, she headed back out west to ABC30 in Fresno, CA. There she was the weekday morning and midday weather anchor.\n\nWhile working full-time, Alena studied online at Mississippi State University and earned a Bachelor of Science in Geoscience.\n\nAfter getting a feel for both sides of the country, Alena is happy to call the Midwest her new home. She joined KCTV5 in September 2018 and is thrilled to be working in a market that gets all four seasons.\n\nYou can catch her forecasts Thursday and Friday at noon and weekend mornings.","slug":"","instagram":"alenakctv5","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"kctv","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"weather","last_updated_date":"2023-05-10T20:00:11.399Z"}}}]},"display_date":"2023-07-26T23:46:50.083Z","description":{"basic":"Dangerous heat index values at or above 105 degrees are likely.

joined KCTV5 in March 2022.\n\nBorn and raised in Kansas City, Greg has been a lifelong lover of the City of Fountains. Greg graduated in 2015 from the University of Missouri's School of Journalism, at which he spent time as a reporter, producer and anchor for KOMU-TV.\n\nFrom Columbia, Greg moved southwest to the Fort Smith-Fayetteville, Arkansas area and was an assignment manager at KFSM-TV, a CBS affiliate. Just a little more than a year later, he moved back to Columbia, Missouri and worked as the digital executive producer at KRCG-13 for nearly three and a half years.\n\nHe moved to Washington, D.C. in February 2020 to take on the role of social media manager at WJLA-TV, working in the nation's capital during the last year of the Trump presidency and the first year of the Biden regime. Two years later, he was thrilled to accept a position back in his hometown, a goal from the moment he started journalism school.\n\nWhen not at work, Greg is likely to be at a Royals game, visiting one of KC's BBQ joints or spending time with family (and there are a lot of them).\n\nIf you have a story idea, feel free to send to Gregory.Dailey@kctv5.com.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"kctv","last_updated_date":"2022-04-15T13:53:26.948Z","twitter":"https://twitter.com/GregDaileyNews","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/GregDaileyNews"}}}]},"display_date":"2023-07-26T17:39:00.336Z","description":{"basic":"Hill was a key member of the Super Bowl LIV champion squad in 2019 and was even named to the NFL 2010s All-Decade Team as a punt returner."},"headlines":{"basic":"Report: Tyreek Hill says he will go to NFL Hall of Fame as a Miami Dolphin","meta_title":"","mobile":"","native":"","print":"","tablet":"","web":""},"promo_items":{"basic":{"_id":"PN45PUMOHBHENEDICAKKCUFBOM","additional_properties":{"countryId":227,"fullSizeResizeUrl":"/resizer/7_CMBRylQ6C-4oyR02m_O5tvcwc=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/PN45PUMOHBHENEDICAKKCUFBOM.jpg","galleries":[],"ingestionMethod":"manual","iptc_job_identifier":"CAMS506","iptc_source":"AP","iptc_title":"STF","keywords":[""],"mime_type":"image/jpeg","originalName":"AP22346086732331 (1).jpg","originalUrl":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/PN45PUMOHBHENEDICAKKCUFBOM.jpg","owner":"peter.burke@wptv.com","proxyUrl":"/resizer/7_CMBRylQ6C-4oyR02m_O5tvcwc=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/PN45PUMOHBHENEDICAKKCUFBOM.jpg","published":true,"resizeUrl":"/resizer/7_CMBRylQ6C-4oyR02m_O5tvcwc=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/PN45PUMOHBHENEDICAKKCUFBOM.jpg","restricted":false,"takenOn":"2022-12-12T02:15:44Z","thumbnailResizeUrl":"/resizer/XhwKMurYJTUlEUT6QGFio7ryT1w=/300x0/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/PN45PUMOHBHENEDICAKKCUFBOM.jpg","usage_instructions":"AP stations","version":0,"template_id":32},"address":{"locality":"Inglewood","region":"CA","country_name":"USA"},"auth":{"3":"b218f7bb42e56856a06530b5f6fa90b1bb960ec012771ebe807534c16074ed4a"},"caption":"Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill (10) scores a touchdown after recovering a fumble during the second quarter against the Los Angeles Chargers, Sunday, Dec. 11, 2022, in Inglewood, Calif.","copyright":"Copyright 2022 The Associated Press.

joined the KCTV5 team in January 2023 as a morning reporter. Before coming to Kansas City, he worked at KCTV’s sister station, KOLN, in Lincoln, Nebraska. \n\nHe is originally from Richmond, Virginia and is a proud graduate of Virginia Tech. While at Virginia Tech he studied Journalism and Finance.  \n\nNathan first started his broadcasting career in radio as an on-air producer for ESPN Blacksburg while still in undergrad. While in Lincoln, he reported in the morning for the local CBS station, 10/11 NOW, and co-hosted a two-hour radio show “On the Block w/ Nate and Strick” in the afternoons on 93.7 The Ticket. Nathan still makes guest appearances on both radio stations. \n\nIn his free time, you can find him watching sports, working out or playing golf. He didn’t spend much time in Nebraska but considers himself a Husker enthusiast and can often be found cheering on his Hokies or Huskers. He considers himself a “homer” and has already claimed to be a Chiefs and Royals fan. Nathan grew up playing baseball and played against Royals first baseman, Vinnie Pasquantino, in middle school. He says it’s safe to assume Vinnie is the better athlete. \n\nNathan is a morning guy through and through. He is an advocate for starting the morning off right and is always trying to brighten someone’s day. You can get in touch with Nathan on Twitter or Facebook and let him know what’s making you smile.

Kansas City his home and try new things, especially the BBQ.\n\nHe attended Ohio University studying Journalism and Sociology. He hosted their Emmy Award Winning “Gridiron Glory” football show on WOUB-TV, was a reporter for the basketball show, “Hardwood Heroes,” and news reporter for their “Newswatch” evening shows as well. \n\nJoe takes pride in moving around several times in Ohio and to a suburb of Chicago growing up where he was able to meet people from a variety of backgrounds. He believes it’s a big part of deciding to go into journalism.\n\nBeing near Chicago in high school, he played football and basketball against some of the best players in the country. Fun fact: He got dunked on by former Kansas guard Isaiah Moss in a high school tournament. He says it was embarrassing and is forever thankful that no cameras were around that day.\n\nJoe is a Cincinnati Bengals fan at heart, but he does enjoy watching the Chiefs play and being around the Chiefs Kingdom.
