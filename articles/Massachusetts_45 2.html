Currently, she works as a content producer and multimedia journalist.  Olivia regularly appears in the station's newscasts covering varying topics such as the Chester water emergency, the Springfield Thunderbirds, and even a local father rescuing his daughter from the war-torn country of Ukraine.\n\nBefore joining the Western Mass News team, Olivia was an intern-turned-freelancer for NPR-affiliate Connecticut Public Radio, where she gained hands-on experience covering topics in the Connecticut Capital.\n\nOlivia earned her BA in communication and journalism from the University of Connecticut in 2020.\n\nDescribed as a \"triple threat\" by one of her professors, Olivia reported for UCTV Channel 14, 91.7FM WHUS, and the Daily Campus, UConn's independent newspaper during her college career. She covered topics for the news outlets, including former basketball coach Jim Calhoun's Title IX lawsuit, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the famous HuskyTHON dance marathon. Olivia also lead an investigative team to highlight UConn voting trends for the 2020 presidential election.\n\nDuring her time at UConn, Olivia was also a freelancer for the New London-based Newspaper, The Day, covering faith communities in the city for an independent study. The project won first place in \"Excellence in Newsroom Collaboration and Partnerships\" at the 2022 New England Newspaper & Press Association awards.\n\nWhen Olivia isn't reporting, she is working out, spending time with friends, or continuing her hunt for the best bacon egg and cheese in western Mass. Olivia would love hear from you! For story ideas and questions, shoot her an email or reach out on Facebook.

She grew up in southern New Jersey and saw a few big storms that scared her to death.\n\nJanna's father told her how in the Midwest the sky would turn green before tornadoes developed-this sparked curiosity that would develop into a passion by the time she was a teenager.\n\nJanna was researching colleges before her first day of high school and decided on Lyndon State in northern Vermont. There, her passion for severe weather and storm chasing shifted and she became interested in television and broadcasting weather to the public.\n\nNot long after graduating with a degree in meteorology, she took her first job as a freelancer for News 12 Traffic and Weather in Woodbury, NY. For four years she freelanced for the morning and evening weathercasts for five television stations across the New York City metro area.\n\nJanna took her first full time job back in 2010 as the morning meteorologist for WVVA-TV in Bluefield, WV, where she would go on to work for six years and served as their chief meteorologist for four of those years.\n\nThe craziest weather she's seen and forecasted includes a tornado in Brooklyn, NY, Hurricane Sandy which socked WV with heavy snow, the 2012 derecho, and the 2016 flood that devastated parts of southern West Virginia.\n\nJanna is so happy to be back in New England and working for Western Mass News! She brings her Philly sports pride with her, along with her three cats and two dog, or 'traveling zoo'. You can usually find her at a game with her husband or watching football, hockey or baseball, playing golf, taking pictures, or playing with the pup at the dog

News, Daniel was working in production for the show \"Good Day New York\" at WNYW-TV FOX 5 in New York.  Before that, he interned at NBCUniversal (Telemundo 47), where he was an assignment editor.\n\nDaniel is fully bilingual in Spanish and English. He graduated in December 2022 with his master’s degree in journalism from the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at CUNY. While he was there, he focused his efforts on learning all things TV news. While studying, he interned for Rolling Stone, covering culture, wrote for USA Today, covering the LGBTQIA+ community in the United States, and wrote for City Limits, covering elections, the Latinx community in New York City, and public safety.\n\nDaniel is a Puerto Rico native and graduated from the Universidad del Sagrado Corazón (University of the Sacred Heart, PR) in 2012 with a bachelor’s degree in communications with a minor in digital media.\n\nIn his spare time, Daniel likes to bake, go to live concerts, go on hikes, travel with his partner Ahmad, and daydream about owning a Bernese

soon!).","slug":"","instagram":"iamdanielsantiago","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"wggb","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","custom_gray_displaypriority":"10","last_updated_date":"2023-06-01T14:34:52.096Z"}}},{"_id":"Kevin-Culverhouse","type":"author","version":"0.5.8","name":"Kevin

Carnivale joined Western Mass News as an evening anchor in July 2023","longBio":"Abbey Carnivale joined Western Mass News as an evening anchor in July 2023. A “people person” in every sense of the word, this career has allowed her to connect and share the stories of communities she cares so deeply about.\n\nPrevious to Western Mass News, she worked in Spectrum News’ statewide newsroom in Upstate New York as a reporter and anchor when needed. From West Point Football to congressional elections, unexpected migrant relocations to Demar Hamlin’s collapse, she dipped her toe into every topic imaginable. Before that, she called West Hartford, Connecticut “home” and spent four years producing content for ESPN platforms.\n\nShe hails from South Jersey, right outside of Philadelphia, which explains her love (often irrationally) for Philadelphia sports.  At a young age, her family moved to northern Maryland, where Abbey was a competitive gymnast and softball player. It turns out a good floor routine translates well to the diamond, too. She went to Ohio University and graduated from the E.W. Scripps School of Journalism in 2017.\n\nWhen not at the desk with Chris Pisano, she’s hanging out at home with her boyfriend and their goldendoodle, Homie.  You can also find her at the gym or at an occasional yoga class.  On any given weekend, she’s visiting her parents, who recently moved back to New Jersey and are loving the life down the shore.\n\nFeel free to reach out whenever you’d like via email or social. Abbey is an open book and “all ears” for our community. Plus, have a restaurant recommendation? This foodie is all ears.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"wggb","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","custom_gray_displaypriority":"3","last_updated_date":"2023-07-18T15:07:03.807Z","instagram":"@abbey_carnivale","twitter":"abbey_carnivale","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100064796324103"}}},{"_id":"erik-rosario","type":"author","version":"0.5.8","name":"Erik

News, Daniel was working in production for the show \"Good Day New York\" at WNYW-TV FOX 5 in New York.  Before that, he interned at NBCUniversal (Telemundo 47), where he was an assignment editor.\n\nDaniel is fully bilingual in Spanish and English. He graduated in December 2022 with his master’s degree in journalism from the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at CUNY. While he was there, he focused his efforts on learning all things TV news. While studying, he interned for Rolling Stone, covering culture, wrote for USA Today, covering the LGBTQIA+ community in the United States, and wrote for City Limits, covering elections, the Latinx community in New York City, and public safety.\n\nDaniel is a Puerto Rico native and graduated from the Universidad del Sagrado Corazón (University of the Sacred Heart, PR) in 2012 with a bachelor’s degree in communications with a minor in digital media.\n\nIn his spare time, Daniel likes to bake, go to live concerts, go on hikes, travel with his partner Ahmad, and daydream about owning a Bernese Mountain dog (hopefully soon!).","slug":"","instagram":"iamdanielsantiago","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"wggb","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","custom_gray_displaypriority":"10","last_updated_date":"2023-06-01T14:34:52.096Z"}}},{"_id":"ryan-trowbridge","type":"author","version":"0.5.8","name":"Ryan

Having lived in Hamden and Wallingford, I know how wonderful this area is. I am a Quinnipiac University alumnus with a journalism master’s degree. My outstanding professors taught me the craft and the importance of accurate and fair news reporting. At QU, I ran Division I cross-country, captaining the Bobcats my senior year. My coach, Carolyn Martin, taught me important life lessons about contributing to a team. Now I have the opportunity to be a supportive member of the hardworking WFSB news team. Like them, I will responsibly, accurately and compassionately report the news each day.  \n\nBefore coming back to CT, I spent three years reporting in Pennsylvania, where I received the 2022 Excellence in Broadcasting Award from the Pennsylvania Association of Broadcasters. I was raised in Bergen County, New Jersey where my parents, both broadcast news veterans, shared with me their passion for news writing and reporting. When I was 13, I began reporting for my local newspaper. In high school, I was the on-air play-by-play sportscaster for our football and basketball games. \n\nIn my spare time, I enjoy playing basketball, running (I’m not as fast as I used to be!), spending time with friends & family and watching the New York Mets. \n\nI am very grateful for this opportunity to join the WFSB team.

It puts out about 40 percent of what’s called infrared, which causes the planet to heat up, and then it causes about, emits about 10 percent of what’s called ultraviolet light, which is invisible and the ultraviolet light is broken up into two wavelengths. One is something called UVB, which are the burning rays of the sun and these are the ones that cause sunburn, and the second rays are called UVA rays and those are called the photoaging parts of the sun. And this ultraviolet light, over time, is cumulative, so that it causes changes in the skin. The UVA light causes photo aging, such as brown spots and lines and wrinkles and the UVB light causes sunburn and also the two lights together tend to cause skin cancer, so protection is very important.”"},{"_id":"K4XEKHRRNJDSBN2SWTH52MP55Q","type":"text","additional_properties":{"comments":[],"inline_comments":[]},"content":"<b>What’s the best ways that you can protect yourself from the sun?</b>"},{"_id":"HEFJGUK4UZB3BLT4ZCLN75HDAQ","type":"text","additional_properties":{"comments":[],"inline_comments":[]},"content":"Glaser: “Well, obviously, not to go out in the sun, but one needs to understand that it’s not just the sun.
