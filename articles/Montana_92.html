      <p>Montana has, by and large, beautiful  summer weather. This is generally standard throughout the entire state, too.  Generally, from July through September (summer in Montana), it tends to be  generally dry throughout Montana, with sunshine the norm, with only a few days  of clouds and light rain. Yet, despite the sunshine, temperatures are generally  not too hot except during periods of heat waves.</p>
      <p>In western Montana, look for typical  summer days to run from the mid-70&rsquo;s to around 90, depending where in western  Montana you are and at what elevation you find yourself. Over in eastern  Montana, highs will generally be a tad warmer overall, with highs in the 80&rsquo;s  and low 90&rsquo;s. During periods of heat waves, though, temperatures throughout  most of Montana can soar into the low 100&rsquo;s. It is during these times that you  want to escape to the higher elevations to avoid some of the heat. Temperatures  cool off noticeably, though, once summer flows into September &ndash; although the  days are still generally dry and sunny. </p>
      <p>Thunderstorms occur during the summer months;  however, they aren&rsquo;t especially common. Generally, more thunderstorms occur in  the eastern half of Montana than in the western half in the summer, although  the mountains can have some fantastic lightning storms. </p>
      <p>Moreover, many of the thunderstorms  that occur in Montana during the summer, particularly over the mountainous  areas, are dry thunderstorms. These are the most deadly of storms, since they  produce huge amounts of lightning that spawn wildfires while not dropping any  rain. These dry thunderstorms are quite common in Montana during the summer,  and are the main cause of most wildfires in the state.</p>
      <p>Another thing that needs to be  remembered during the summer is that although daytime temperatures can be quite  warm, night temperatures usually plummet. This is especially so in the higher  elevation valleys, like the <a href="/River-Fishing/SW-MT-Rivers/bighole-river/bighole_river_overview.shtm">Big Hole River</a> valley. It is common to fall below  freezing in places like Wisdom and <a href="/Montana-Info/west_yellowstone_mt.shtm">West Yellowstone</a>, even during the height of  summer when daytime high temperatures can hit 80 degrees or more. Yet, even  outside of these cold spots, most nights in Montana have temperatures in the 40&rsquo;s  or lower 50&rsquo;s.</p>
      <p>Snow in Montana during July and August  happens, but not often. Generally, if snow does happen in July or August, it  only effects the higher elevations of the taller mountains in Montana. It is  very rare for snow to fall in any of the major Montana cities during July or  August.</p>
      <p>This changes, though, beginning in  September. Generally, the first snow of the season coats the higher mountain  elevations in Montana in September. Occasionally the snow will also reach the  lower elevations, although the snow will not stick around long. The nice thing  about September snows is that it coincides with the changing of the colors in  the mountains &ndash; making for beautiful sights.</p>

      <p>Fall weather in Montana begins usually  sometime in late September and will run into November. During this time,  weather can be highly variable &ndash; with weeks of Indian summer weather, followed  by cold rain, and then snow. During the fall, it becomes normal to see eastern  Montana having colder weather than western Montana, too. The reason is because  the first cold air of the season usually arrives from Canada.</p>
      <p>Western Montana weather, beginning in  the fall, also usually begins to start getting cloudy in October (although  lately October seems to have been as nice as September usually is). Typically,  what happens in October is a mix of sunny days followed by a week of colder  temperatures under cloudy skies, with some light rain and higher elevation snow  thrown in for good measure. November weather brings with it colder  temperatures, more precipitation and much more cloud cover (at times, you&rsquo;ll be  lucky to have more than a few sunny days in November in western Montana).</p>
      <p>Eastern Montana will also experience  big temperature changes, really more so than over in western Montana as it can  still occasionally get quite warm in eastern Montana in October as warm air can  occasionally gets sucked up from the south. Additionally, during October the  first arctic air masses from Canada generally arrive, leaving eastern Montana  under cold temperatures while the western part of the state basks in relative  warmth.</p>
      <p>Out in eastern Montana, snow can fall  at anytime during the fall, although it generally won&rsquo;t actually start sticking  and hanging around until November in most areas.</p>
      <h2>Winter Weather in Montana</h2>
      <table border="0" align="right" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="photoTable">
        <tr>
          <td class="photoTableImage"><img src="/Montana-Info/ski-areas/big-mtn/inversion_glacier-280.jpg" width="280" height="210"></td>

      </table>
      <p>Winter sees some extremes in Montana  weather. During the winter, it is very common for the areas east of the  Continental Divide to be in the deep-freeze of below zero temperatures while over  in <a href="/Montana-Info/missoula_mt.shtm">Missoula</a> and <a href="/Montana-Info/kalispell_mt.shtm">Kalispell</a> the temperature can be fifty degrees warmer and  without a wind chill to boot.</p>
      <p>As mentioned earlier, this occurs due  to the inability of most cold air masses to make their way over the Continental  Divide. A couple of times each winter, though, the cold air is deep enough  (high enough) to force its way through the mountain passes along the  Continental Divide, sneaking through places like Logan Pass, Marias Pass,  Rogers Pass and other low elevation passes. When this happens, western Montana,  particularly northwest Montana,&nbsp; can  become just as cold if not colder than eastern Montana. Moreover, when this  happens the cold air has a nasty tendency to hang around for quite a long time.  This is due to the peculiar topography of NW Montana, the huge valleys and tall  mountains trap the cold air, preventing it from being shoved out.</p>
      <p>Western Montana during the winter  receives much more snow, generally, than areas in eastern Montana. However, all  areas of Montana can receive deep snows. Eastern Montana, along with the  occasional deep snow, also suffers from the curse of seemingly always blowing  snow.</p>
      <p>Not surprisingly, eastern Montana also  is much windier during the winter than is found in western Montana, just like  during the summer months. This wind, besides making the wind chill plummet,  also has a nasty tendency to blow the snow that does fall in eastern Montana  all over the place. Huge drifts frequently form behind houses, barns, small  hills and behind anything else that the wind can&rsquo;t blow away. Snow fences along  eastern Montana highways, which help to capture snow and prevent it from  blowing onto the highway, are also a common sight.</p>
      <p>How much snow falls in Montana  changes, often dramatically, from year to year. The tall mountains in Montana,  even those found in the eastern part of the state, often receive very  substantial snow falls &ndash; generally ending the year with well over 100 inches of  snowpack (snowpack = packed snow depth, not how much snow actually fell during  the year. To create a 100-inch snowpack by early April usually requires well  over 250 inches of snowfall during the course of the winter).</p>
      <p>By contrast, the lower valleys in  western Montana tend to avoid the deep snow that happens in the mountains. The  mountains tend to draw away the moisture of big storms, leaving lighter  snowfalls for the low elevation valleys. Generally, most lower valley locations  in western Montana tend not to receive more than 50-70 inches of snow a year.</p>
      <p>This changes, though, for  high-elevation valleys and plateaus, like West Yellowstone and Cooke City. In  these locations, substantially more snow can be expected.</p>
      <h2>Spring Weather in Montana</h2>
      <table border="0" align="right" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="photoTable">
        <tr>
          <td class="photoTableImage"><img src="../Home-page-graphics/Lake_McDonald (290x218)_no_canvas.jpg" width="290" height="218"></td>

      </table>
      <p>Spring in Montana can be both a  delight and a curse, all at the same time. Snow can and does fall throughout  the spring in most areas of Montana, with the snowfall probability lessening as  spring wears on. While June snowstorms can and have happened virtually  everywhere in Montana, it is a rare for most valley locations to receive snow.  Instead, the mountains will often receive snow while the valleys receive rain.</p>
      <p>Spring is also the rainy season in  Montana. During May and June, Montana tends to receive the most moisture of the  year. When this moisture actually happens, it goes a long way towards  preventing the torrid forest fires that so often make national news. As  mentioned, most of the moisture in the valleys falls in the form of rain during  the springtime.</p>
      <p>The mountains, however, receive a mix  of rain and snow. During April, mountain areas tend to receive snow as the main  form of moisture. This begins to shift in May, with the low and mid-elevation  mountains receiving rain while only the upper peaks of the mountains receive  snow. By June, most mountain peaks tend to receive rain as well, although snow  can and does happen in the mountains in June almost yearly. Additionally, June  rain in the mountains has a tendency to be a cold rain, not a warm spring  shower.</p>
      <p>As spring is the rainy season in  Montana and because the state is dominated by northwest Pacific flows, western  Montana can be very slow to warm up following winter. In western Montana, in  fact, it seems at times during May and June that summer will never arrive, with  often week long events of clouds, cool air and light spring showers being the &ldquo;norm.&rdquo;  Needless to say, this kind of weather is not something that summer dreams are  made out of!</p>
      <p>Eastern Montana, owing to its  location, tends to warm up much more quickly in the spring than does western  Montana. While the scorching weather of July and August rarely hits this part  of the state before early-June, it does happen for brief periods during the  spring. Moreover, the rain events in this area tend to be more of the heavy  rain variety followed by clearing skies, unlike the steady light rain/drizzle  that so often plagues western Montana for weeks on end, especially northwest  Montana.</p>

      <p>Well, that is Montana weather in a nutshell. There is  much more to Montana weather, of course, than what this guide lays out.  Numerous sub-zones are located within both eastern and western Montana weather  zones. The sub-zones often have dramatic changes in weather than what is listed  here during particular times of the year. Additionally, the mountains in  Montana often create their own weather at any moment. As such, while the broad,  general rules in this guide are a good rule to go by when planning a trip to  Montana (such as figuring out what kinds of clothes to bring), if you plan on venturing  out into the mountains, always be prepared for virtually anything. The lack of  preparedness by many a visitor has caused more than a few deceased hikers, anglers  and other backcountry adventurers.</p>
