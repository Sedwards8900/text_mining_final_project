Wind speeds are largely from long-term surface airways weather observation sites, data buoys, lighthouses and C-MAN stations, with limited data from other networks (e.g. RAWS). Stations with long histories are preferred because of the research focus on intercomparison of historic storms. Numbers preceded by a tilde (~) represent the highest gust report in a dataset that has been interrupted at the height of the storm--usually data loss is from power outages. Values in italics are gust values estimated from peak wind, usually 1-minute or 5-minute, using a 1.3 gust factor. Stations with high-wind criteria gusts (58 mph or 93 km/h) are denoted with white-filled circles. Isotachs depicting &ge;60 mph (~100 km/h) to &ge;120 mph (~190 km/h) gusts in 20 mph (~30 km/h) increments  are included to highlight the regions that had concentrations of the indicated magnitudes.

            <TD WIDTH="100%"><P><FONT SIZE=+2>W</FONT>ith little fear of exaggeration, it
              can be stated that the Columbus Day Storm of 1962 was the most powerful windstorm
              to strike
              the Pacific Northwest in the 20th century. Certainly no windstorm since
              has generated as much widespread devastation as the Big Blow, not even close.
              Comparisons of peak gusts, where they can be had, tend to put the Big Blow
              at the top, but such figures are abstract, and often don't reveal the very
              reasons why those who lived through the Columbus Day Storm remember it so
              vividly. The sudden violence of the wind compelled many people to take cover
              in their homes or basements, a lasting memory, and the sheer magnitude of
              destruction, in literally all categories of accounting, puts this storm
              far above any other. For example, the northwest Oregon town of Lake Oswego
              had about 4,000 houses within its borders in 1962--the Columbus Day Storm
              damaged 70% of these structures [1]. A more typical windstorm might not
              even harm this many houses within the entire range of its influence. Indeed
              throughout the Willamette Valley, undamaged homes were the exception, not
              the rule. In 1962 dollars, the Columbus Day Storm caused an estimated
              $230-280 million in damage to property in California, Oregon, Washington
              and British Columbia combined, with $170-200 million happening in Oregon
              alone [2]. This damage figure is comparable to eastern hurricanes that made
              landfall in the 1957-1961 time period: Audrey, 1957, $150M, Donna, 1960,
              $387M, and Carla, 1961, $408M [3]. The &quot;Big Blow&quot; was declared
              the worst natural disaster of 1962 by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company.
              In terms of timber loss, about 11.2 billion board feet was felled by the
              Big Blow in Oregon and Washington combined. In sheer gustiness of wind,
              as indicated by the ratio of maximum gust speed to sustained wind speed,
              called the gust factor, the Columbus Day Storm behaved more like a hurricane
              than a typical midlatitude cyclone [4]. The large number of 1,000-year-old
              plus trees blown down suggests that the Columbus Day Storm may have been
              the event of the millennium [5], though such inferences are speculative
              at best.</P>
              <P>The Columbus Day Storm was born explosively when the highly degraded
                extratropical remains of typhoon Freda drifted into a powerful storm formation
                zone off of northern California and regenerated the ailing cyclone [6].
                The extratropical cyclone origin gives the event a unique place among Northwest
                windstorms, for, as far as is known, this has not happened at any other
                time in the period of climatological record. Certainly the remains of dead
                typhoons have arrived on the Pacific Coast on many occasions since 1950,
                but few have come ashore as strong storms, and none but the ghostly remains
                of Freda in 1962 have been spun into a terrific wave cyclone. The abundant
                energy that arrived with the tropical system may partly explain the level
                of violence achieved during the Big Blow. And this tropical influence suggests
                that the storm of 1962 be placed in its own category. A lone, dark overachiever
                whose closest cousins may be those powerful extratropical storms experienced
                on the East Coast, such as post-landfall hurricane Hazel of 1954. There
                are other reasons for a unique place in Pacific Northwest climatology, such
                as pressure tendencies that mirrored fast-moving landfalling systems while
                the center of the Columbus Day cyclone stayed offshore, as will be discussed
                in detail in the storm data section, and simply the storm's incredible peak
                wind velocities (more on this shortly).</P>
              <P>The Columbus Day Storm struck at a time when many regularly reporting
                weather stations were operating. This gives the Big Blow a unique place
                when it is compared to major events that are deeper in the past, such as
                the 1880 Storm King. With a large body of good data, the storm can be studied
                in great detail, from its formation, to its track, and its effects at a
                wide variety of locations. Of course, many storms have struck during the
                period of excellent climatological record. Out of all these tempests, the
                Columbus Day Storm was an event that generally stands far above the others.</P>
              <P>It is for the above reasons that the Columbus Day Big Blow is often used
                as a benchmark for comparing windstorms, as is done at this website. Thus,
                many facts and figures about the Columbus Day Storm are found on pages dedicated
                to other windstorms.</P>
              <P>However, caution should be used when making certain types of comparisons.
                As discussed on the December 12, 1995 windstorm page, there are aspects
                about the Columbus Day Storm that are different from the standard attack
                from a big cyclone passing northward off of the Pacific Coast. The Columbus
                Day cyclone's minimum central pressure of about 960 mb really wasn't that
                unusual among the other big storms of history [7]. For instance, with a
                minimum pressure of 954 mb, the December 1995 storm was deeper, as was the
                November 1981 storm's 958 mb [8]. However, the Columbus Day winds were much
                stronger than the 1995 and 1981 storms. The 11-station average peak gust
                figures used on this website reveal this: 61.4 for December 1995, 65.9 for
                November 1981, and a screaming 80.5 for Columbus Day 1962 [9]. The Big Blow
                of 1962 was the only storm to break 70 in the 11-station measure for the
                1950-to-present era, and it accomplished this by a large margin! The Columbus
                Day Storm is an outlier, a singularity. An event like the Columbus Day Storm
                probably won't happen again for another 100 years, maybe even 1,000. For
                some comparisons, the Columbus Day Storm probably should be put in its own
                category--especially when trying to forecast the peak wind potential of
                a new cyclogenic bomb based on windstorm climatology.</TD>

                and a hurricane's gusts often reach 1.5 times the sustained windspeed. Though
                many locations saw gusts in the 1.3 range in the Columbus Day Storm, there
                were those with significantly higher ratios: take Bellingham, WA, for instance,
                which reported at 23:58 PST sustained winds of 58 mph with gusts to 98.

              <P><B>Table 1</B>, <I>below</I>, compares the Columbus Day Storm peak gusts
                to those of Hurricane Hazel. There is a tendency among weather officials
                not to do these kinds of comparisons because the two types of storms--midlatitude
                cyclones and hurricanes--are so different. There is also the added &quot;taint&quot;
                from the fact that the Columbus Day Storm was generated in part by entraining
                the extratropical remains of typhoon Freda, and the news media in some cases
                suggested that the Columbus Day Storm <I>was</I> Freda. However, hurricane
                Hazel, after making landfall near Myrtle Beach, SC, and then shooting northward
                up the Eastern Seaboard, &quot;degenerated&quot; into a very powerful extratropical
                cyclone, according to some interpretations of the events in 1954. (For hurricanes
                that accelerate rapidly northward, it often becomes difficult to ascertain
                just when the core becomes extratropical. See especially Simpson, R. H.,
                and Riehl, H, &quot;The Hurricane and its Impact,&quot; pp. 178-184 for
                more a more thorough discussion of this fact.) So possibly Hazel wasn't
                a far cry different from the Columbus Day Big Blow--both storms seem to
                have spent part of their existence in a gray zone between solidly defined
                hurricanes and midlatitude cyclones, the mark of Nature's disdain for the
                hard categories often created by humans. And, indeed, there are plenty of
                similarities between Hazel and the Columbus Day Storm: both storms had a
                significant tropical influence, both made landfall in mid-October, the two
                storms first struck to the south and then veered northward at a fast clip
                and raced all the way into Canada, they kicked up record wind speeds over
                a large part of their prospective afflicted coastal strips, and they dumped
                heavy rains over large regions. And so, we have the side-by-side comparisons
                of wind speeds below. This is to remind the reader just how powerful the
                Columbus Day Storm was, evidence that the Pacific Northwest can be struck
                by truly severe weather on occasion.</TD>

            <TD WIDTH="100%"><P>When comparing Tatoosh Island with Astoria in the above meteograms, note
              the strong east winds that picked up ahead of the incoming storm at both
              stations. East winds tend to escalate at these two stations, and others,
              including Portland, ahead of the big storms, as the pressure gradients tend
              to be favorable for airflow from that direction. On Columbus Day 1962, east
              gusts at Astoria reached 43 mph during the first spike of winds on the meteogram,
              whereas the trace at Tatoosh is much more exxagerated, with gusts as high
              as 78 mph. Indeed, the pre-low-center-passage easterly winds at Tatoosh
              were much stronger than the westerly winds that picked up after the cyclone's
              center passed over the island. This has created some confusion among lists
              of peak gusts for the Columbus Day Storm. Some meteorologists from the time
              didn't &quot;count&quot; the easterly winds that escalated ahead of the
              storm, and listed the peak gust as 62 mph for Tatoosh, which was the westerly
              maximum. This is probably because the mechanism for generating the two separate
              periods of maximum winds was somewhat different. However, 78 mph speaks
              pretty loudly, and, on this web page, I use this value for Tatoosh's peak.</P>

              <P>Coastal station barographic traces compared in absolute time. This graphic
                demonstrates the rapid intensification of the storm as it progressed northward
                just off the Oregon coast. Peak intensity was achieved before the time the
                cyclone had reached the latitude of Astoria, as indicated by a sharp V-trace,
                and the lowest pressure of the four stations. Note that North Bend's actual
                low pressure was 28.70&quot; at 14:30, which was between the hourly observations.
                By the time the low had reached Tatoosh Island, it had weakened and broadened,
                making a curve more reminiscent of later storms, like <A HREF="November1981.html">November
                  1981</A> and <A HREF="December1995.html">December 1995</A>. Note that the
                cyclone's center almost passed right over Tatoosh, while it raced northward
                about 50 miles west of Astoria. That the Tatoosh trace doesn't show a sharper
                curve than Astoria under these circumstances is a pretty clear sign of a
                degrading storm system.</TD>

                Station pressure tends to be lower than pressures adjusted to sea-level,

                dip of the October 11th storm to the left center. For the Columbus Day Storm,
                note the sharply defined double-dip at the bottom of the &quot;V&quot;,
                a feature was turned up strongly at Willamette Valley stations during this
                storm. The initial dip was due to the passage of the storm's leading front.
                This kind of double-dip signature has appeared in many windstorms, often
                more weakly than the one below. Apparently, double-dips didn't get much
                attention until the Columbus Day Storm's clear examples, and this feature

              The magnitude of the storm caused much worry over the barogram. The needle
              started flirting with the bottom of the graph around 13:32, forcing a reset,
              and the indicator was raised a full 1.00&quot;. The needle began to rise
              shortly after, and was reset back to its original position at 14:25. However,
              the storm's famous double-dip caught the forecasters off-guard, and the
              needle dropped below the bottom border of the graph around 15:20. The barometer
              was then reset 0.50&quot; at 15:40, and left alone until 19:00, when it

              <P>[1] Among the hourly sea-level pressure notations at Salem, the lowest
                reading was 28.86&quot;. Sea-level pressure was not indicated in the special
                reports between the hourly observations. However, altimeter was noted in
                the special reports. In the case of Salem, the lowest altimeter pressure
                indicated was 28.79&quot; at 16:20 HRS. Salem's lowest pressure has been
                stated as 28.80&quot; in a number of publications.</P>

              gradients, and time of occurrence, for the two storms. The passage of an
              upper-level trough behind the October 11th storm caused short-lived barometric
              drops for stations in the north part of the region. Pressure gradients tightened
              again during the night--in some cases more strongly than during the passage
              of the Oct 11th cyclone--and wind speeds elevated to gale force in places
              like Astoria and Tatoosh Island. Thus, the region strongly affected by this
              upper-level trough experienced three separate gale-wind events in the span
              of about 30 hours from October 11th to 12th.</P>
              <P>Of the gradient measures for the Columbus Day Storm, the ACV-OTH, OTH-AST,
                MFR-EUG and AST-DLS readings are the highest in the 1950-to-present record.
                The December 12, 1995 windstorm holds the record for steepest ACV-AST with
                +33.9 mb (+1.00&quot;), the October 21, 1934 storm holds the records for
                OTH-TTI with +33.2 mb (+0.98&quot;) and SEA-BLI with +11.5 mb (+0.34&quot;),
                the Otober 2, 1967 storm holds the record for EUG-PDX with +13.7 mb (+0.40&quot;),
                and the January 20, 1993 &quot;Inaguration Day Storm&quot; holds the record
                for PDX-SEA with a whopping +15.4 mb (+0.45&quot;). The +17.0 mb (+0.50&quot;)
                reading for the MFR-EUG measure during the Columbus Day Storm is nothing
                short of phenomenal--the next two highest events for this measure were +14.8
                mb (+0.44&quot;) on October 2, 1967 and +13.3 mb (+0.39&quot;) on December
                4, 1951.</P>

              <P><B>Table 4</B>, <I>below</I>, lists the maximum hourly pressure falls
                and rises achieved during the Columbus Day Storm for 11 Pacific Northwest
                stations. These tendencies are phenomenal, the mark of a truly unique storm.
                The 11-station average peak declension of -4.6 mb (-0.14&quot;) per hour
                is the highest in the 1950-to-present era. Only the windstorms of December
                21, 1955 with -4.1 mb (-0.12&quot;) and December 4, 1951 with -4.4 mb (-0.13&quot;)
                have come close to the extreme Columbus Day Storm value. The story is the
                same for average pressure rise. The Columbus Day Storm's average value of
                +6.2 mb (+0.18&quot;) is in a class by itself, with the runners-up being
                the Thanksgiving Day storm of 1983 with +4.4 mb (+0.13&quot;), the powerful
                cyclone of December 12, 1995 with +4.5 mb (+0.133&quot;) and the windstorm
                of February 24, 1958 with +5.2 mb (+0.15&quot;) for eight of these stations
                (TTI, EUG and PDX missing pressure data during the February 24, 1958 storm).</P>
              <P>Interestingly, despite the high average tendencies, when individual stations
                are examined, very few long-standing records were set on Columbus Day 1962.
                Only the peak climb values for Medford, Eugene, Salem and Bellingham still
                stand as records today, and Eugene only because the pressure surge from
                the <A HREF="February2002.html">February 7, 2002</A> South Valley Surprise
                started between the regular observation times, resulting in a +7.5 mb (+0.21&quot;)
                peak reading on the hour (16:54), when indeed a +10.2 mb (+0.30&quot;) rise
                occurred in about 48 minutes (from 16:24 to 17:12).</P>
              <P>The high average hourly declension for the Columbus Day Storm is no different.
                Still-standing records were set at just Astoria and Salem during the Columbus
                Day Storm. The storms that produced the higher readings for both pressure
                fall and climb at the other stations are quite varied. Often the record
                setter is a cyclone that passed very close to a particular station, and
                because of this nature, it is almost always a different storm for each station's
                record. The list is long and convoluted. For example, there's North Bend.
                The +8.8 mb (+0.26&quot;) surge on Columbus Day of 1962 was incredible--rarely
                do one-hour pressure rises reach into the eight-mb range in the Pacific
                Northwest--but it is far short of the truly astounding one-hour surge of
                +16.6 mb (+0.49&quot;) during a landfalling cyclone on November 10, 1975 and +14.2
                mb
                (+0.42&quot;) also
                during
                another landfalling storm on
                February
                7, 2002. The 1975 and 2002 storms were very localized to Southwest Oregon. For
                example, on february 7, 2002, Astoria,
                at
                the north end of the state, had a meager +2.4 mb (+0.07&quot;) maximum climb
                out of the event, far short of the +7.7 mb (+0.23&quot;) surge seen on Columbus
                Day 1962, and Astoria's all-time biggest hourly jump of +8.0 mb (+0.24&quot;)
                during the <A HREF="January1993.html">Inauguration Day storm</A> of 1993.</P>
              <P>That the Columbus Day Storm set the all-time maximum average pressure
                tendencies for the 1950-to-present era while not setting most individual
                station records, reflects on an event that strongly affected the entire
                region quite uniformly, unlike many of the individual station record-setters.</P>

              <P>[1] Power outage at 18:08 resulted in estimated wind direction after
                this time.</P>
              <P>[2] Values for Portland are officially estimated readings. Peak SSW winds
                reached 46 mph gusting to 72 at 17:32--the last instrument reading before
                a power failure at 17:46 stopped the instruments. A fastest mile taken up
                to 17:46 yielded 88 mph, the highest value for this wind measure ever recorded
                at Portland. The estimated peak gust of 90 knots (104 mph) falls closely
                in line with the peak of 106 mph reported at the nearby Troutdale Airport.
                Had there been no wind estimations at the Portland Airport, the readings
                from Troutdale would have been the substitutes. The peak winds of 69 mph
                and already mentioned triple-digit gust wouldn't have changed the storm's
                11-station averages significantly.</TD>

              is the highest observed 1-minute average, and &quot;Peak Gust&quot; is highest
              instantaneous speed (sometimes referred to a peak 1-second gust), with some
              exceptions: The Oak Harbor NAS average reading is for a 1-hour period, with
              peak instant gust. Power was lost during the height of the storm at some
              of these stations, including Red Bluff, Sexton Summit, Roseburg, and Paine
              Field. This could have resulted in missed wind readings, which suggests

              <P>Shown below is a copy of the original surface observation form for Corvallis,
                OR, used for the time period October 10th to October 15th. Weather observations
                were fairly routine up to 14:00 on October 12th. Then the 15:00 observation
                was missed, and what followed is quite extraordinary. Winds at 16:00 had
                elevated to 60 knots gusting to 85 (69 mph gusting to 98), with a peak gust
                noted at 110 knots (127 mph)! Just a few moments later, at 16:15, &quot;ABANDONED
                STATION&quot; is clearly written in the middle of the form. The next day,
                it is also noted, &quot;Unreported from 04:00 - 12:00 due power failure
                and instruments demolished.&quot; This is the only time in the history of
                the Pacific Northwest that an officially supervised weather station had
                to be abandoned due to high winds. A strong reminder of just how powerful
                the Columbus Day Storm was.</TD>

              <P>Many eyewitness accounts suggested that the
                Columbus Day Storm was like a hurricane. These comments were sometimes
                made by people who had experienced hurricanes beforehand. Here's a
                piece of weather data that just about corroborates these claims, from
                Red Bluff, California: Rainfall 0.41&quot; in 5 minutes, accumulating to
                0.98&quot; within 15 minutes, with peak average wind 68 mph (fastest mile),
                gusts higher,
                and a temperature around 64 F. The temperature is slightly cool for
                a hurricane, and the average winds weren't quite at the 75 mph cutoff
                for hurricane
                status (plus the highest winds occurred before the heavy rain event),
                but the figures aren't too far off the mark, especially with rainfall
                rates
                at 8.20&quot;/hr
