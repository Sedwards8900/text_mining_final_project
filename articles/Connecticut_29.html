A Meriden native and UConn graduate, Hector is thrilled to be reporting in his home state! Before coming back home Hector was a sports/news reporter at WLNE-ABC6 in Providence, R.I. He also filled in on the anchor desk for news and sports as well.\n\nIn Providence, Hector covered a wide range of stories from Patriots and Bruins games to the legalization of marijuana. He was also on Martha's Vineyard when about 50 Venezuela migrants were sent there from Texas. Before Providence, Hector began his Journalism career at WWLP-TV in Springfield, Mass. In Springfield, Hector covered multiple political races, snow storms and was the first TV reporter on scene when multiple bodies were found in the backyard of a Springfield home. He also covered multiple Patriots playoff games, a Bruins Stanley Cup and a Red Sox World Series.\n\nWhen he isn't reporting Hector is watching sports (especially his UConn Huskies!!), trying new restaurants and spending time with family and friends. \n\nHave a story idea?

He has been part of the Channel 3 Early Warning Forecast Team since July 2003.","longBio":"Nominated for multiple Emmy Awards for weather anchoring; Mark has also won the award for \"Best Weathercast\" from the Connecticut Associated Press Broadcaster's Association on numerous occasions. A member of the American Meteorological Society, Mark has been recognized by his peers with the prestigious AMS Seal of Approval.\nMark cultivated an interest in weather at an early age. He jokes that he declared his major as a Cub Scout when he toured a television station in his hometown of Tulsa, Oklahoma at the age of 8. His fascination with weather continued as he grew up in the heart of Tornado Alley. As only a junior in high school, Mark interned at KJRH-TV, and when it came time for college, he moved on to the University of Oklahoma, a top school in the country for meteorology and the best for severe weather research and forecasting.\nIt is at OU that he earned a Bachelor of Science in Meteorology. Mark began his on-air career while attending college, as a junior, at the same station where he toured and interned in Tulsa.\nAfter graduating, Mark moved on to Little Rock, Arkansas for his first full-time job, where he won an Associated Press award: \"Best Weather Segment\" for a summer heat demonstration. He also was highly involved with the inception and development of his station's local WeatherNet.\nFrom growing up and working in Oklahoma and then working in Arkansas, his experience with the severity of Tornado Alley has provided him with extensive experience pertaining to all types of extreme weather.  Working with recently retired Bruce DePrest, a forecaster of New England weather for over 40 years, has enabled him to hone his forecasting abilities in the realm of winter storms.  In Connecticut now for nearly 2 decades, Mark has clearly made the Nutmeg State his home.  \nMark's favorite part about living in this part of the country is the diversity of the weather and the extremes that can accompany the different seasons… from severe weather, to tropical weather, to nor'easters, to a gorgeous autumn day.\nIn addition to his duties as meteorologist, Mark has actively been a part of the Connecticut Science Center, dating back to when it was only a parking lot in Hartford. Also, for 4 years, he also served as the host of WFSB's \"Cool Schools\" franchise. A platform that gave him an opportunity to showcase all of the fun and unique things happening at schools all across the state.\nOutside of the station, Mark enjoys spending time at the gym and at times running. \nIn the realm of running, he has completed eight marathons: Oklahoma City, Dallas White Rock, Chicago, Austin, St. Louis, Little Rock, Hartford and New York City. Those were all accomplished a while ago, he now focuses on 5k, 10k and half marathon distances. He has even dabbled in the realm of triathlon, completing sprint and Olympic distance events.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"wfsb","last_updated_date":"2022-09-14T13:25:43.587Z","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"weather"}}}]},"display_date":"2023-07-27T03:34:31.922Z","description":{"basic":"The

Having lived in Hamden and Wallingford, I know how wonderful this area is. I am a Quinnipiac University alumnus with a journalism master’s degree. My outstanding professors taught me the craft and the importance of accurate and fair news reporting. At QU, I ran Division I cross-country, captaining the Bobcats my senior year. My coach, Carolyn Martin, taught me important life lessons about contributing to a team. Now I have the opportunity to be a supportive member of the hardworking WFSB news team. Like them, I will responsibly, accurately and compassionately report the news each day.  \n\nBefore coming back to CT, I spent three years reporting in Pennsylvania, where I received the 2022 Excellence in Broadcasting Award from the Pennsylvania Association of Broadcasters. I was raised in Bergen County, New Jersey where my parents, both broadcast news veterans, shared with me their passion for news writing and reporting. When I was 13, I began reporting for my local newspaper. In high school, I was the on-air play-by-play sportscaster for our football and basketball games. \n\nIn my spare time, I enjoy playing basketball, running (I’m not as fast as I used to be!), spending time with friends & family and watching the New York Mets. \n\nI am very grateful for this opportunity to join the WFSB team.

A Meriden native and UConn graduate, Hector is thrilled to be reporting in his home state! Before coming back home Hector was a sports/news reporter at WLNE-ABC6 in Providence, R.I. He also filled in on the anchor desk for news and sports as well.\n\nIn Providence, Hector covered a wide range of stories from Patriots and Bruins games to the legalization of marijuana. He was also on Martha's Vineyard when about 50 Venezuela migrants were sent there from Texas. Before Providence, Hector began his Journalism career at WWLP-TV in Springfield, Mass. In Springfield, Hector covered multiple political races, snow storms and was the first TV reporter on scene when multiple bodies were found in the backyard of a Springfield home. He also covered multiple Patriots playoff games, a Bruins Stanley Cup and a Red Sox World Series.\n\nWhen he isn't reporting Hector is watching sports (especially his UConn Huskies!!), trying new restaurants and spending time with family and friends. \n\nHave a story idea?

Having lived in Hamden and Wallingford, I know how wonderful this area is. I am a Quinnipiac University alumnus with a journalism master’s degree. My outstanding professors taught me the craft and the importance of accurate and fair news reporting. At QU, I ran Division I cross-country, captaining the Bobcats my senior year. My coach, Carolyn Martin, taught me important life lessons about contributing to a team. Now I have the opportunity to be a supportive member of the hardworking WFSB news team. Like them, I will responsibly, accurately and compassionately report the news each day.  \n\nBefore coming back to CT, I spent three years reporting in Pennsylvania, where I received the 2022 Excellence in Broadcasting Award from the Pennsylvania Association of Broadcasters. I was raised in Bergen County, New Jersey where my parents, both broadcast news veterans, shared with me their passion for news writing and reporting. When I was 13, I began reporting for my local newspaper. In high school, I was the on-air play-by-play sportscaster for our football and basketball games. \n\nIn my spare time, I enjoy playing basketball, running (I’m not as fast as I used to be!), spending time with friends & family and watching the New York Mets. \n\nI am very grateful for this opportunity to join the WFSB team.

I had never even heard of the area but took my first reporting job sight unseen.\nAt WAAY31, I was a weekday reporter and produced/anchored the Saturday morningshow. \n\nMost recently, I was Emmy nominated for my contribution to a newscast, “End of Watch Sgt.

He also filled in on the anchor desk for news and sports as well.\n\nIn Providence, Hector covered a wide range of stories from Patriots and Bruins games to the legalization of marijuana. He was also on Martha's Vineyard when about 50 Venezuela migrants were sent there from Texas. Before Providence, Hector began his Journalism career at WWLP-TV in Springfield, Mass. In Springfield, Hector covered multiple political races, snow storms and was the first TV reporter on scene when multiple bodies were found in the backyard of a Springfield home. He also covered multiple Patriots playoff games, a Bruins Stanley Cup and a Red Sox World Series.\n\nWhen he isn't reporting Hector is watching sports (especially his UConn Huskies!!), trying new restaurants and spending time with family and friends. \n\nHave a story idea?
