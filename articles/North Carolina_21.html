Maria’s center came within 155 miles of Cape Hatteras, NC early Wednesday morning, but the storm had begun angling away from the coast at 6 mph, to the north-northeast, as of 11 am EDT Wednesday. Maria brought winds near minimal tropical storm-force along the Outer Banks early Wednesday morning. The highest winds observed on Wednesday morning at the <a href="https://www.wunderground.com/MAR/buoy/HCGN7.html" target="_blank">USCG station at Cape Hatteras</a>, NC were 39 mph, gusting to 47 mph, at 12:36 am EDT. The <a href="http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/station_page.php?station=41025" target="_blank">Diamond Shoals buoy</a> located 15 miles southeast of Cape Hatteras had peak sustained winds of 42 mph, gusting to 51 mph, at 2:50 am EDT. An observing site at Jennette's Pier in Nags Head, North Carolina, measured a sustained wind of 43 mph, gusting to 51 mph, late Wednesday morning.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/quicklook/view.html?name=MARIA" target="_blank">NOAA Tides and Currents Quicklook</a> page for Maria, a peak storm surge of 2.8’ was observed at Cape Hatteras, NC near 2 am EDT Wednesday; the highest surge at Duck, NC was 2.0’ near 3 am. Storm surge heights of 1.5 – 2.0’ were observed Wednesday morning along the Virginia coast near Norfolk. Wednesday morning’s high water levels <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/news/us/article/The-Latest-The-ocean-is-angry-tourism-12231782.php" target="_blank">resulted in some overwash of NC 12</a>, the only road into or out of the Hatteras-Ocracoke section of the Outer Banks.</p><p><a href="http://www.ssd.noaa.gov/PS/TROP/floaters/15L/15L_floater.html" target="_blank">Satellite imagery</a> on Wednesday showed that Maria was a large and sloppy-looking storm, with its heavy thunderstorm activity confined to the east side of the center, away from where strong upper-level winds of 15 – 20 knots out of the northwest were shearing the storm. Maria no longer has an eye or an eyewall, and its weak outer spiral bands on the west side were bringing rain showers to the Outer Banks, as seen on <a href="https://www.wunderground.com/weather-radar/united-states-regional/nc/charlotte" target="_blank">regional radar</a>.</p><table style="width: 837px;" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" border="0"><tbody><tr><td><img class="media-element file-default" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/s.w-x.co/wu/sep27-goes16.jpg" alt="GOES-16 view of large Hurricane Maria (left) and small Hurricane Lee (right) at 10:45 am EDT Wednesday, September 27, 2017" title="GOES-16 view of large Hurricane Maria (left) and small Hurricane Lee (right) at 10:45 am EDT Wednesday, September 27, 2017" width="835" height="563"></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Figure 1.</strong> GOES-16 view of large Hurricane Maria (left) and small Hurricane Lee (right) at 10:45 am EDT Wednesday, September 27, 2017.

GOES-16 imagery is considered preliminary and non-operational.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><strong>Forecast for Maria</strong></h2><p>Maria will continue to move over the cool waters churned up last week by Hurricane Jose, and is expected to continue experiencing moderate wind shear over the next few days. Our <a href="http://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/gc_wmb/vxt/HWRFForecast/RT2017_NATL/MARIA15L/MARIA15L.2017092706/MARIA15L.2017092706.fsct.png" target="_blank">top intensity models predict</a> that a slow weakening of Maria will result. All of our top models predict that Maria has made its closest approach to North Carolina, and will turn to the east-northeast by Thursday, as a trough of low pressure passing to the north pulls the storm out to sea. By Saturday, Maria will lose its tropical characteristics as it speeds towards Europe, and the extratropical remnants of Maria will likely bring tropical storm-force winds of 39+ mph to portions of the British Isles on Sunday.</p><table style="width: 722px;" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" border="0"><tbody><tr><td><img class="media-element file-default" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/s.w-x.co/wu/lee-ir-1445Z-9.27.17.png" alt="Enhanced infrared image of Hurricane Lee at 10:45 am EDT Wednesday, September 27, 2017." title="Enhanced infrared image of Hurricane Lee at 10:45 am EDT Wednesday, September 27, 2017." width="720" height="359"></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Figure 2.</strong>&nbsp; Enhanced infrared image of Hurricane Lee at 10:45 am EDT Wednesday, September 27, 2017.

Lee’s top sustained winds were 115 mph at <a href="http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT4+shtml/271448.shtml?">11 am EDT</a>, making it a low-end Cat 3 storm. Lee is this year’s fifth major hurricane in the Atlantic, after Harvey, Irma, Jose, and Maria. Those four predecessors all hit Category 4 or 5 strength, and all of them but Jose proved to be devastating, multi-billion-dollar storms. Fortunately, Lee is flexing its muscle far from land in the central North Atlantic, close to 500 miles east-southeast of Bermuda.</p><p>An overnight eyewall replacement cycle helped put Lee over the top. Lee’s original small eye, around 15 miles wide on Tuesday, was replaced by a cleared-out, 35-mile-wide eye, surrounded by a somewhat stronger core of showers and thunderstorms. Lee’s wind field has expanded as well: hurricane-force winds extended out up to 35 miles from Lee’s center, and tropical-storm-force winds extended as far as 90 miles.</p><p>Moving northwest at 7 mph, Lee had already begun a recurvature that will take the storm north and northeast at an accelerating pace later this week. It’s possible Lee will intensify a bit more between Wednesday and Thursday morning, but from that point on Lee should be weakening rapidly. Wind shear will leap from its current 10 – 15 knots to more than 30 knots by late Thursday, and Lee will be passing over progressively cooler waters, with sea-surface temperatures below the 26°C (79°F) threshold by Thursday night.</p><p>Strong upper-level flow will haul both Maria and Lee across the North Atlantic this weekend. The remnants of both hurricanes may be swept into intense midlatitude storminess affecting the British Isles and northern Europe from Sunday into Tuesday, although as the UK Met Office <a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/news/releases/2017/a-wet-and-windy-start-to-october">noted Wednesday</a>, "there may end up being one large area of low pressure or several separate systems. So at this time, while we can say that many places will see a period of wet and windy weather later this weekend and into next week, we can’t say which areas of the UK will see the wettest or windiest weather."</p><h2><strong>Watching the waters near Florida next week for new development</strong></h2><p>One area we need to watch for development early next week is the waters surrounding Florida. A trough of low pressure over the region will be joined by a cold front that will push south over the Florida peninsula on Saturday and then stall near <a href="https://www.wunderground.com/forecast/us/fl/miami/33101" target="_blank">South Florida</a> by Sunday. An area of low pressure capable of developing into a tropical depression could form along the front over the weekend or early next week; this development could occur on either the Gulf or Atlantic side of the Florida Peninsula.</p><p>About 30% of the 70 members of the 0Z Wednesday GFS and European model ensemble predicted development of a tropical depression in the waters surrounding Florida by early next week, and the 12Z operational run of the GFS model predicted that an area of low pressure close to tropical depression strength would form on Saturday afternoon, a few hundred miles east of the Central Florida coast. Steering currents early next week will be pushing anything that might develop westward, into the Gulf of Mexico. Wind shear is expected to be moderate to high in the Gulf early next week, which will limit any potential development there. In their 2 pm EDT Wednesday <a href="http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/gtwo.php?basin=atlc&amp;fdays=5" target="_blank">Tropical Weather Outlook</a>, NHC gave this area 2-day and 5-day odds of development of 10% and 20%, respectivley. The next name on the Atlantic list is Nate.</p><p><em>Bob Henson contributed to this post.</em></p></div><!----><lib-cat-six-article-scripts _ngcontent-sc278=""><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async="" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"></script></lib-cat-six-article-scripts><lib-cat-six-disclaimer _ngcontent-sc278=""><p><!----><small class="ng-star-inserted"> The Weather Company’s primary journalistic mission is to report on breaking weather news, the environment and the importance of science to our lives.

Maria’s center came within 155 miles of Cape Hatteras, NC early Wednesday morning, but the storm had begun angling away from the coast at 6 mph, to the north-northeast, as of 11 am EDT Wednesday. Maria brought winds near minimal tropical storm-force along the Outer Banks early Wednesday morning. The highest winds observed on Wednesday morning at the &l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/MAR/buoy/HCGN7.html\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;USCG station at Cape Hatteras&l;/a&g;, NC were 39 mph, gusting to 47 mph, at 12:36 am EDT.

An observing site at Jennette&s;s Pier in Nags Head, North Carolina, measured a sustained wind of 43 mph, gusting to 51 mph, late Wednesday morning.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;According to the &l;a href=\&q;https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/quicklook/view.html?name=MARIA\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;NOAA Tides and Currents Quicklook&l;/a&g; page for Maria, a peak storm surge of 2.8’ was observed at Cape Hatteras, NC near 2 am EDT Wednesday; the highest surge at Duck, NC was 2.0’ near 3 am. Storm surge heights of 1.5 – 2.0’ were observed Wednesday morning along the Virginia coast near Norfolk.

Maria no longer has an eye or an eyewall, and its weak outer spiral bands on the west side were bringing rain showers to the Outer Banks, as seen on &l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/weather-radar/united-states-regional/nc/charlotte\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;regional radar&l;/a&g;.&l;/p&g;&l;table style=\&q;width: 837px;\&q; cellspacing=\&q;1\&q; cellpadding=\&q;1\&q; border=\&q;0\&q;&g;&l;tbody&g;&l;tr&g;&l;td&g;&l;img class=\&q;media-element file-default\&q; src=\&q;https://s3.amazonaws.com/s.w-x.co/wu/sep27-goes16.jpg\&q; alt=\&q;GOES-16 view of large Hurricane Maria (left) and small Hurricane Lee (right) at 10:45 am EDT Wednesday, September 27, 2017\&q; title=\&q;GOES-16 view of large Hurricane Maria (left) and small Hurricane Lee (right) at 10:45 am EDT Wednesday, September 27, 2017\&q; width=\&q;835\&q; height=\&q;563\&q; /&g;&l;/td&g;&l;/tr&g;&l;tr&g;&l;td&g;&l;strong&g;Figure 1.&l;/strong&g; GOES-16 view of large Hurricane Maria (left) and small Hurricane Lee (right) at 10:45 am EDT Wednesday, September 27, 2017.

Our &l;a href=\&q;http://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/gc_wmb/vxt/HWRFForecast/RT2017_NATL/MARIA15L/MARIA15L.2017092706/MARIA15L.2017092706.fsct.png\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;top intensity models predict&l;/a&g; that a slow weakening of Maria will result. All of our top models predict that Maria has made its closest approach to North Carolina, and will turn to the east-northeast by Thursday, as a trough of low pressure passing to the north pulls the storm out to sea. By Saturday, Maria will lose its tropical characteristics as it speeds towards Europe, and the extratropical remnants of Maria will likely bring tropical storm-force winds of 39+ mph to portions of the British Isles on Sunday.&l;/p&g;&l;table style=\&q;width: 722px;\&q; cellspacing=\&q;1\&q; cellpadding=\&q;1\&q; border=\&q;0\&q;&g;&l;tbody&g;&l;tr&g;&l;td&g;&l;img class=\&q;media-element file-default\&q; src=\&q;https://s3.amazonaws.com/s.w-x.co/wu/lee-ir-1445Z-9.27.17.png\&q; alt=\&q;Enhanced infrared image of Hurricane Lee at 10:45 am EDT Wednesday, September 27, 2017.\&q; title=\&q;Enhanced infrared image of Hurricane Lee at 10:45 am EDT Wednesday, September 27, 2017.\&q; width=\&q;720\&q; height=\&q;359\&q; /&g;&l;/td&g;&l;/tr&g;&l;tr&g;&l;td&g;&l;strong&g;Figure 2.&l;/strong&g;&a;nbsp; Enhanced infrared image of Hurricane Lee at 10:45 am EDT Wednesday, September 27, 2017.

Lee’s top sustained winds were 115 mph at &l;a href=\&q;http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT4+shtml/271448.shtml?\&q;&g;11 am EDT&l;/a&g;, making it a low-end Cat 3 storm. Lee is this year’s fifth major hurricane in the Atlantic, after Harvey, Irma, Jose, and Maria. Those four predecessors all hit Category 4 or 5 strength, and all of them but Jose proved to be devastating, multi-billion-dollar storms. Fortunately, Lee is flexing its muscle far from land in the central North Atlantic, close to 500 miles east-southeast of Bermuda.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;An overnight eyewall replacement cycle helped put Lee over the top. Lee’s original small eye, around 15 miles wide on Tuesday, was replaced by a cleared-out, 35-mile-wide eye, surrounded by a somewhat stronger core of showers and thunderstorms. Lee’s wind field has expanded as well: hurricane-force winds extended out up to 35 miles from Lee’s center, and tropical-storm-force winds extended as far as 90 miles.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Moving northwest at 7 mph, Lee had already begun a recurvature that will take the storm north and northeast at an accelerating pace later this week. It’s possible Lee will intensify a bit more between Wednesday and Thursday morning, but from that point on Lee should be weakening rapidly. Wind shear will leap from its current 10 – 15 knots to more than 30 knots by late Thursday, and Lee will be passing over progressively cooler waters, with sea-surface temperatures below the 26°C (79°F) threshold by Thursday night.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Strong upper-level flow will haul both Maria and Lee across the North Atlantic this weekend. The remnants of both hurricanes may be swept into intense midlatitude storminess affecting the British Isles and northern Europe from Sunday into Tuesday, although as the UK Met Office &l;a href=\&q;https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/news/releases/2017/a-wet-and-windy-start-to-october\&q;&g;noted Wednesday&l;/a&g;, \&q;there may end up being one large area of low pressure or several separate systems. So at this time, while we can say that many places will see a period of wet and windy weather later this weekend and into next week, we can’t say which areas of the UK will see the wettest or windiest weather.\&q;&l;/p&g;&l;h2&g;&l;strong&g;Watching the waters near Florida next week for new development&l;/strong&g;&l;/h2&g;&l;p&g;One area we need to watch for development early next week is the waters surrounding Florida. A trough of low pressure over the region will be joined by a cold front that will push south over the Florida peninsula on Saturday and then stall near &l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/forecast/us/fl/miami/33101\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;South Florida&l;/a&g; by Sunday. An area of low pressure capable of developing into a tropical depression could form along the front over the weekend or early next week; this development could occur on either the Gulf or Atlantic side of the Florida Peninsula.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;About 30% of the 70 members of the 0Z Wednesday GFS and European model ensemble predicted development of a tropical depression in the waters surrounding Florida by early next week, and the 12Z operational run of the GFS model predicted that an area of low pressure close to tropical depression strength would form on Saturday afternoon, a few hundred miles east of the Central Florida coast. Steering currents early next week will be pushing anything that might develop westward, into the Gulf of Mexico. Wind shear is expected to be moderate to high in the Gulf early next week, which will limit any potential development there. In their 2 pm EDT Wednesday &l;a href=\&q;http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/gtwo.php?basin=atlc&a;amp;fdays=5\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;Tropical Weather Outlook&l;/a&g;, NHC gave this area 2-day and 5-day odds of development of 10% and 20%, respectivley.

For a rainbow to form, water droplets must be present in the air in front of an observer and the sun must be shining from behind the observer. Rainbows result from the refraction and reflection of sunlight by these water droplets. (&l;/em&g;&l;a href=\&q;https://opensky.ucar.edu/islandora/object/imagegallery%3A371\&q;&g;&l;em&g;Bob Henson, via UCAR Digital Image Library&l;/em&g;&l;/a&g;&l;em&g;)&l;/em&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Given that the very first entry in Dr. Jeff Masters&a;rsquo; WunderBlog (the original name of this blog) was &a;ldquo;&l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/the-360degree-rainbow.html\&q;&g;The 360-degree Rainbow&l;/a&g;&a;rdquo;&a;mdash;see the full story in &l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/cat6/So-Long-Wunderground\&q;&g;Jeff&a;rsquo;s farewell post&l;/a&g; from October 2019&a;mdash;I thought it would be apropos for this final Category 6 entry to spotlight another, very different kind of rainbow. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;I took the photo above looking east-northeast while stopped on a drive across northwest Oklahoma in April 1991, with a severe thunderstorm in the distance. I&a;rsquo;d never seen a &a;ldquo;rainbow rise&a;rdquo; before, and I&a;rsquo;ve certainly never seen anything that was as distinct as this. Primary rainbows always form opposite the sun, with an imaginary line running from the sun through the observer&a;rsquo;s head to the center of the rainbow arc. So in order to see a rainbow near the horizon, the sun needs to be almost 42&a;deg; above the opposite horizon. That&s;s typically the case in the early to mid-afternoon (solar time) in midlatitude spring, as was the case on the stormy April day when I snapped this photo.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Rainbows are laden with symbolism, especially about places that lie beyond our human reckoning. When our pets die, we talk about them crossing the &a;ldquo;rainbow bridge.&a;rdquo; A 16-year-old Judy Garland sang longingly about a place &a;ldquo;over the rainbow&a;rdquo; in &a;ldquo;The Wizard of Oz&a;rdquo;&a;mdash;the most famous movie of all time in which a weather event (that mesmerizing tornado!) served as the central plot twist (no pun intended).&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;I like to think of the rainbow pictured above as symbolizing the multitudinous human colors and textures that have made this meeting place what it is. Collectively, our readers have contributed far more content to Category 6 than we regular authors have, and you&a;rsquo;ve made it a welcoming spot for people from many ages, many walks of life, and many corners of the planet. I can&a;rsquo;t do justice to all of you in a single farewell post, but I hope you will each consider this a heartfelt &a;ldquo;thank you&a;rdquo; for every weather tidbit you&a;rsquo;ve shared and every friendship you&a;rsquo;ve cultivated here. I hope you&a;rsquo;ll all sign the yearbook, as it were, in the Disqus comments below (and be sure to check out the moving testimonials at the &l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/cat6/end-of-an-era-category-6-to-close-shop-this-month\&q;&g;&a;ldquo;end of an era&a;rdquo; announcement post&l;/a&g; from June 10).&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;I&a;rsquo;m especially glad that this blog has been a place for serious discussion of human-produced climate change, the environmental issue of our lives. Since Jeff Masters started this blog in 2005, the global concentration of carbon dioxide has &l;a href=\&q;https://scripps.ucsd.edu/programs/keelingcurve/wp-content/plugins/sio-bluemoon/graphs/mlo_full_record.png\&q;&g;risen&l;/a&g; from about 380 to 415 parts per million&a;mdash;an increase of nearly 10%. Methane concentrations have &l;a href=\&q;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_methane#/media/File:Mlo_ch4_ts_obs_03437.png\&q;&g;jumped&l;/a&g; from about 1780 to 1870 parts per billion. And global surface temperature has &l;a href=\&q;https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/global/time-series/globe/land_ocean/ytd/12/1880-2019?trend=true&a;amp;trend_base=10&a;amp;begtrendyear=2005&a;amp;endtrendyear=2020\&q;&g;spiked&l;/a&g; by a frightening 0.5&a;deg;F (0.3&a;deg;C). You&a;rsquo;ve read in our many posts about the consequences: heat- and drought-fueled wildfires, record rains from a juiced-up atmosphere, the effects of a warming planet on a vast range of ecosystems. As disasters typically do, the myriad impacts of climate change tend to hit those who are most vulnerable, including people of color, the hardest. We&a;rsquo;re not doing close to enough to keep this slow-motion catastrophe at bay.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;a href=\&q;https://www.yaleclimateconnections.org/2020/06/commentary-covid-19-is-the-quiz-climate-change-the-final-exam/\&q;&g;As Jeff put it&l;/a&g; this week in a post at &a;ldquo;&l;a href=\&q;https://www.yaleclimateconnections.org/section/eye-on-the-storm/\&q;&g;Eye on the Storm&l;/a&g;,&a;rdquo; his new blogging home:&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&a;ldquo;Many students&a;rsquo; recurring nightmares involve a final exam tomorrow for a course they seldom attended all term: They can&a;rsquo;t remember where the classroom is, and barely studied for the exam. Unfortunately, that nightmare describes humanity&a;rsquo;s situation for the coming climate change final exam. While the stakes for flunking the COVID-19 quiz have been crushing&a;mdash;over 425,000 people dead globally by mid-June, economies crippled, and an as-yet unrealized catastrophe looming for many nations in the developing world&a;mdash;the cost of failing our inevitable collective climate change final exam will be apocalyptic for civilization.&a;rdquo;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Here are a few more words from Dr. Masters on the occasion of Cat 6&a;rsquo;s final post:  &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&a;ldquo;The sun has set upon the Weather Underground blog community. It was an amazing place to learn about weather and share knowledge and experiences with other weather enthusiasts, and my life has been touched and transformed by the people who gathered here. My love and thanks go to all of you who participated in the WU community and made this blog so unique. Huge thanks go to the WU staff who made the user experience unmatched for any weather site on the Internet, and who labored incessantly to keep the servers running. Special thanks go to our volunteer moderators, and to the many fantastic bloggers that have contributed their remarkable insights to WU&a;mdash;Bob Henson, Steve Gregory, Chris Burt, Ricky Rood, Margie Kieper, and Lee Grenci&a;mdash;and to Maximiliano Herrera, for his amazing work keeping track of global weather records. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&a;ldquo;Remember that as the sun sets, the rainbow that it creates rises; as is written in Ecclesiastes, &a;lsquo;Look upon the rainbow, and praise Him who made it.&a;rsquo; I will continue on in my role as your guide to the beauty, power, and danger of our magnificent atmosphere at my new home at &l;a href=\&q;https://www.yaleclimateconnections.org/section/eye-on-the-storm/\&q;&g;yaleclimateconnections.org, &a;lsquo;Eye on the Storm&a;rsquo;.&l;/a&g; I&a;rsquo;ve already made four posts there over the past two weeks, and will crank it up once hurricane season moves into high gear. I&a;rsquo;m particularly excited that Bob Henson has agreed to join in and pitch in during the peak part of hurricane season. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&a;ldquo;While my posts currently do not have a comments section, the good people at Yale Climate Connections have made instituting one their highest priority, and they anticipate that the WU community will have a new home to congregate at in the next few weeks. Your hard-working WU moderators have agreed to come along for the ride, and will be moderating the new comments section.

(Humboldt State University)&l;/em&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;We have all read about famous scientists who helped to shape and steer our knowledge of the world.  Back in the 19th century, there were the likes of Charles Darwin, Louis Pasteur, Thomas Edison, Madame Curie, and many more whose contributions are well documented.  Then there are those names that may have not made it into our grade school and high school history books.  We may know them from other references, like a mountain or ocean current, such as the Humboldt Current off the coast of South America.  &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;I never really thought about who this &a;ldquo;Humboldt&a;rdquo; was and what his contributions might have been.  Coming from Buffalo, New York, I was familiar with places like Humboldt Park and the beautiful tree-lined road that once crossed the city, known as Humboldt Parkway.  &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Decades flew by, until one day in 2016 I was listening to an interview with a historian and author, Andrea Wulf, who had just published a book titled &l;a href=\&q;https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Invention_of_Nature/byjqBQAAQBAJ?hl=en&a;amp;gbpv=1&a;amp;printsec=frontcover\&q;&g;&l;em&g;The Invention of Nature&l;/em&g;&l;/a&g;.  As I listened, I nearly jumped off my chair to hear about the amazing life of the 19th-century Prussian naturalist Alexander von Humboldt.  In particular, I was fascinated with his connections to the science of meteorology and climatology. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;It turns out that Humboldt was one of the world&a;rsquo;s most famous scientists of his era, and a thinker ahead of his time in many ways. As Laura Dassow Walls put it in an American Scientist &l;a href=\&q;https://www.americanscientist.org/article/o-pioneer\&q;&g;review&l;/a&g; of &l;em&g;The Invention of Nature&l;/em&g;, &a;ldquo;How on earth did we ever lose sight of Alexander von Humboldt?&a;rdquo;&l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn0\&q; /&g;&l;h2&g;&l;strong&g;Bringing it together&l;/strong&g;&l;/h2&g;&l;p&g;Science was beginning to advance more and more rapidly in the 19th century as technology, communication, education, and the Industrial Revolution moved forward.  These advances covered the full range of scientific disciplines, including the study of the weather and climate. Here in the U.S., the early 1800s brought a plethora of daily weather observations from all parts of the expanding nation. In Europe, manned and unmanned balloon flights were taking weather instruments to heights never measured before.  Information on the weather and climate from locations around the world was being recorded.  &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;But how could all of this information be shared?  How could one tie it all together?&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Enter Alexander von Humboldt, considered by many to be the father of &l;a href=\&q;file:///Users/bobhenson/Downloads/and%20father%20of%20modern%20geography%20and%20ecology\&q;&g;modern geography and ecology&l;/a&g;. As Wulf noted in &l;em&g;The Invention of Nature&l;/em&g;, he was &a;ldquo;described by his contemporaries as the most famous man in the world behind Napoleon&a;rdquo;. Praises from some of the most famous persons of the time were nearly endless.  Thomas Jefferson called him &a;ldquo;the most scientific man of his age&a;rdquo;.  Charles Darwin said that &a;ldquo;nothing ever stimulated my zeal so much as reading Humboldt&a;rsquo;s Personal Narrative,&a;rdquo; going on to say that he would have never boarded the Beagle (his ship that toured the Galapagos) nor conceived of the Origin of the Species, without Humboldt. Henry David Thoreau read Humboldt&a;rsquo;s books and used them as a template to develop his ability to weave poetry and nature together. Years after Humboldt&a;rsquo;s death, John Muir, America&s;s most famous and influential naturalist and conservationist and founder of the Sierra Club, carried two of Humboldt&a;rsquo;s most famous books with him wherever he journeyed, annotating passages throughout the works. Humboldt&a;rsquo;s book &l;a href=\&q;https://www.amazon.com/Views-Nature-Alexander-von-Humboldt/dp/022642247X\&q;&g;&l;em&g;Views of Nature&l;/em&g;&l;/a&g; even inspired the renowned science fiction writer Jules Verne in some of his greatest works. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;In 1869, on the 100th anniversary of Humboldt&a;rsquo;s birth, the world celebrated this man like no other.  In his home city of Berlin, 80,000 revelers braved a cold, stormy day.  In New York, 25,000 were on hand as a large bronze bust of Humboldt was unveiled. In Boston, Ralph Waldo Emerson told celebrants that Humboldt was &a;ldquo;one of the wonders of the world&a;rdquo;. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;According to &l;em&g;The Invention of Nature&l;/em&g;, &a;ldquo;more places are named after Humboldt than anyone else.&a;rdquo;  There&a;rsquo;s of course the Humboldt Current that runs off the coast of South America, but also Humboldt Glacier in Greenland, mountain ranges on at least three continents, rivers, waterfalls and parks.  In North America, there are 4 counties and 13 towns named for him.  Did you know that Humboldt was among the names proposed for Nevada during a state constitutional convention in 1864?&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Humboldt was born in 1769 in Prussia and, during the course of his long life, set about to study nature on a scale as never before.  What I love about Humboldt is that he was able to see Earth as one great organism where everything was connected.  It was a bold new vision of nature that to this day influences the way in which we understand our natural world. It also connects the scientific thinking of his time with the views of many indigenous cultures around the world that also see Earth as an interconnected system.&l;/p&g;&l;h2&g;&l;strong&g;An exploring spirit&l;/strong&g;&l;/h2&g;&l;p&g;As a young man, Humboldt became fascinated with scientific instruments, meticulously measuring and observing, but he was also driven by the sheer sense of wonder in all that was around him.  Raised during a period of intellectual enlightenment in Europe, Humboldt had the good fortune as a young man to meet some of the greatest explorers and scientist of their age. He read the journals of Captain James Cook, who circumnavigated the globe, and on a visit to London he was able to meet and speak with Joseph Banks, the botanist for Cook&a;rsquo;s first voyage. In his early 20s, Humboldt was in the right place at the right time again when he enrolled in the School of Mines at Freiberg, Germany. The academy taught the latest geological theories and was the home for a thriving scientific community with top students and professors from across Europe.  &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Through his brother Wilhelm, Humboldt met Germany&a;rsquo;s greatest poet of the time, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who also was a passionate scientist with a keen interest in everything from geology to botany.  Over the course of several months working with Goethe, Humboldt continued to form his theories on how nature was connected. Humboldt was the consummate scientist, believing in objectivity and taking the greatest strides to ensure the most accurate measurements and eventual generalization of results. Goethe, meanwhile, aligned himself with the observation process itself and the inevitable subjectivity in human perception and understanding.  Humboldt eventually was able to draw from both perspectives. In fact, as author Wulf notes, &a;ldquo;comparison became Humboldt&a;rsquo;s primary means of understanding nature, not abstract mathematics or numbers&a;rdquo;.  &l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn1\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;At a time when other scientists were searching for the universal laws of nature, Humboldt wrote that nature had to be experienced through feelings. He wanted to travel the world and experience nature in the most personal way.  He was uniquely gifted and well-prepared to accomplish this task.  &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Humboldt was known to have an extraordinary memory.  He could remember the smallest details of the shape of a leaf, the color of a rock, a temperature reading from atop a mountain for years. His mind worked in all directions, and many people noted that when he spoke, he talked so fast that barely anybody could keep up with him.  When he wrote, he would jot down notes on all margins of the page, when he ran out of room he would write on his desk, and as &l;a href=\&q;https://www.amazon.com/Views-Nature-Alexander-von-Humboldt/dp/022642247X\&q;&g;Andrea Wulf notes&l;/a&g;, &a;ldquo;When he ran out of space, Humboldt used his large desk on which he carved and scribbled ideas. Soon the entire table-top was completely covered with numbers, lines and words, so much so that a carpenter had to be called in to plane it clean again.&a;rdquo; &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;After his parents died, Humboldt and his brother Wilhelm received a sizable inheritance that allowed him to live his dreams of exploring the world. In 1799, luck prevailed on him again, when King Carlos of Spain granted him a passport to explore the colonies of Latin America. Soon he was on his first expedition that framed the rest of his life.  In a period of five years, it would change Humboldt from a curious and talented young man to the most extraordinary scientist of his age.  Here is where he would seek nature with both head and heart. &l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn2\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;In a letter to Karl Freiesleben in June of 1799, Humboldt stated &a;ldquo;I shall endeavor to find out how nature&s;s forces act upon one another, and in what manner the geographic environment exerts its influence on animals and plants. In short, I must find out about the harmony in nature&a;rdquo;. He set out from Spain with Aim&a;eacute; Bonpland, a French botanist who accompanied him throughout Latin America.  &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;As would be expected by someone as meticulous as Humboldt, he was very prepared for his scientific journey.  In a &l;a href=\&q;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00431672.2016.1226641\&q;&g;Weatherwise article&l;/a&g; on Humboldt, Stephen Vermette noted that Alexander took with him no less than 42 instruments ranging from &a;ldquo;navigation and surveying to a microscope to observe small detail and to identify species, and instruments to measure magnetism&a;rdquo;.  His cache included two mercurial barometers, several thermometers, a rain gauge, two hygrometers to measure humidity, a cyanometer to measure the blue color of the sky, a hypsometer which determines the temperature at which water boils at different altitudes and a eudiometer to measure the volume of gases. With those tools, he was able to compare observations he had made all over the world across decades and thousands of miles of exploration, allowing him to begin to interconnect nature on a world-wide scale. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;As noted above, one of the most astonishing traits that characterized Humboldt was his amazing memory. Whenever he picked up a plant, rock or insect, that brain was wired in a way that allowed his mind to race back to what he had seen in Europe years before and instantly make a comparison, allowing him to connect these observations across the globe. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Humboldt&a;rsquo;s South American expedition culminated in the ascent of Chimborazo, an extinct volcano that rose nearly 21,000 feet into the atmosphere. At that time, Chimborazo was considered by Europeans to be the highest mountain in the world. The harrowing climb almost took his life.  As noted in The Invention of Nature, porters abandoned him and his team of scientists at 15,600 feet. They continued on, experiencing nausea and dizziness with altitude sickness, bloodshot eyes, bleeding gums, and nearly constant vertigo. But despite these difficulties, Humboldt still had the energy to set up his instruments every few hundred feet of ascent, and with half-frozen hands was able to continue to take extremely accurate measurements of temperature and pressure among others. They made it to 19,413 feet&a;mdash;a higher elevation than any European had experienced before, even the continent&a;rsquo;s early balloonists.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;When Humboldt reached that point and looked across the vista from Chimborazo, his amazing mind was able to trace back to all the plants, rocks, and measurements he had made on his journeys in Europe through the Alps and Pyrenees.  At once everything he had ever observed fell into place. It was as if he could see nature as a &a;ldquo;web of life&a;rdquo;. This new idea of nature was to forever change the way in which people understood the natural world. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;For Humboldt, the climb of Chimborazo had been like a botanical journey that moved from the equator to the poles, from tropical plants on the valleys to lichens at the tree line. At once, he saw all of nature laid out before him.  He formulated that new vision into a single sketch that illustrated nature as a web into which everything was connected.  He called the sketch his Naturgem&a;auml;lde&a;mdash;in essence, &a;ldquo;a painting of nature&a;rdquo;.  &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;For the first time in Western science, the Naturgem&a;auml;lde showed that nature was a globally connected force with corresponding climate zones across continents.  As shown below, the extremely intricate sketch showed a mountain front and center, with several columns of writing on either side. By picking a particular height up the mountain in one column, one could trace across the mountain to other columns to see the temperature and atmospheric pressure, while at the same time what species of animals and plants could be found at different elevations. &l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn3\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;The temperature and pressure measurements recorded by Humboldt on his ascents were the first empirical evidence that linked decreasing temperatures to increasing altitude. This relationship allowed him to better understand the link between climate and vegetation zones. As he put it, &a;ldquo;The great elevation attained in several tropical countries, not only by single mountains but even extensive districts, enables the inhabitants of the torrid zone to behold also those vegetable forms which, demanding a cooler temperature, would seem to belong to other zones.&a;rdquo; &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Humboldt&a;rsquo;s ability to relate the growth of vegetation to their surroundings essentially defined climate. This revelation was integral in the work of Wladimir K&a;ouml;ppen (1846&a;ndash;1940), whose name is linked to the K&a;ouml;ppen Climate Classification System that remains in common use today.&l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn4\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;As a result of his journeys and expeditions, by 1817, at the age of 48, Humboldt had measured the weather in enough places to create a map that connected points of equal temperatures across the globe. This was the world&a;rsquo;s first isothermic map, a term coined by Humboldt (although not the first map of isolines ever produced; Edmund Halley, 1656&a;ndash;1742, is recognized as the first to draw isolines). Humboldt&a;rsquo;s goal was to develop a better understanding of the global distribution of plant species. In his travels in South America, Humboldt was impressed by how similar species were between these New and Old Worlds, hypothesizing that temperature played a key role. This was a milestone in weather and climate analysis.  &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Humboldt noted, &a;ldquo;Thus we see that circles of equal annual heat, or&a;mdash;to use a new term&a;mdash;isotherms, are not parallel to the equator but &a;hellip; they cut the geographic parallels under a variable angle slantwise.&a;rdquo; This was a revolutionary observation, since up to that time, the concept of &a;ldquo;climate&a;rdquo; was essentially derived from the Greek word for inclination, which essentially coupled a location&a;rsquo;s climate to latitude. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;On Humboldt&a;rsquo;s isothermal chart below (1817), you can clearly see that the lines of constant temperature are not strictly zonal (west-east), but rather dip over the North American continent and rise over the North Atlantic Ocean. This is essentially the first rendition of a map to show the how the temperature of continents differed from the coastal areas, running colder in the winters and warmer in the summers for the same latitude, a concept now known as continentality. The rise in the isotherms over the North Atlantic also reflects the extension of the warm Gulf Stream, known as the North Atlantic Drift, toward the British Isles.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;There was yet another connection that Humboldt discovered regarding ocean currents and climate, while sailing off the west coast of South America.  In his measurements of the velocity and temperature of those waters, he discovered a cold ocean current&a;mdash;the Humboldt Current, as it is now called.  &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Finally, in the bottom right-hand corner of the figure below, he plots the temperature with altitude showing the relationship to both.  As noted in Stephen Vermette&a;rsquo;s Weatherwise article, the discovery of that current eventually provided the evidence and connection to explain the &a;ldquo;aridity of coastal Peru and Ecuador: cooled air passing over the current limits precipitation. In short, Humboldt&a;rsquo;s measurements and observations added three new climate controls&a;mdash;altitude, continentality, and ocean currents&a;mdash;to the one climate control (latitude)&a;rdquo; that had been the rule up until that time.&l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn5\&q; /&g;&l;h2&g;&l;strong&g;Humboldt&a;rsquo;s expanding vision&l;/strong&g;&l;/h2&g;&l;p&g;Humboldt was considered one of the first scientists to tie together the concept of human-induced climate change.  As noted in &l;em&g;The Invention of Nature&l;/em&g;, &a;ldquo;he was the first to explain the fundamental functions of the forest for the ecosystem and climate: the trees&a;rsquo; ability to store water and enrich the atmosphere with moisture, the protection of the soil, and their cooling effect.&a;rdquo; He discussed the impacts of trees on climate through the release of oxygen, noting the effect of the human species intervention was already &a;ldquo;incalculable&a;rdquo;, insisting that it could become catastrophic if they continued to disturb the world so &a;ldquo;brutally&a;rdquo;.   &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Humboldt&a;rsquo;s writing was not limited to science. He also spoke out against the brutality of slavery, at a time when it was widespread. After he had returned to Europe, in 1810, Humboldt wrote a book titled &l;em&g;Political Essay on the Island of Cuba&l;/em&g;. In this book, he called slavery &a;ldquo;possibly the greatest evil ever to have afflicted humanity&a;rdquo; and proposed setting aside public funds to buy slaves their freedom. As &l;a href=\&q;https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2012/novemberdecember/feature/humboldt-in-the-new-world\&q;&g;noted by Anna Maria Gillis&l;/a&g; in the NEH journal Humanities, &a;ldquo;Humboldt&a;rsquo;s ideas so infuriated officials in Havana that they banned his book.&a;rdquo;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;The culmination of Humboldt&a;rsquo;s journeys and knowledge was his multi-volume book series entitled Cosmos. The first volume, which he published at the age of 76 in 1845, was unlike any previous book on nature. Unlike other scientists, he did not write about one topic. Rather he tied all of nature, from outer space to the inner core of the planet, together. Wulf notes that &a;ldquo;where other scientists focused only on meteorological data such as temperature and weather, Humboldt was the first to understand climate as a system of complex correlations between the atmosphere, oceans and landmasses.&a;rdquo; Cosmos sold over 20,000 copies in German in its first couple months. Two years later, another 40,000 copies in English sold, many of those to U.S. readers, establishing him as a household name across North America. &l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn6\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;Humboldt was the consummate Renaissance man. In addition to his amazing journeys to remote parts of the globe, he shaped the way in which we all view nature today. He was able to tie it all together and treat the world as one interconnected ecosystem.  He had a wonderful curiosity and treated nature as something you live and experience with all of your senses. I encourage you to explore much more about Humboldt&a;rsquo;s life and legacy, starting with the book I have already read twice: &l;a href=\&q;https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Invention_of_Nature/byjqBQAAQBAJ?hl=en&a;amp;gbpv=1&a;amp;printsec=frontcover\&q;&g;&l;em&g;The Invention of Nature&l;/em&g;&l;/a&g;. &l;/p&g;\n&q;,&q;wxnodes&q;:[{&q;id&q;:&q;wxn0&q;,&q;type&q;:&q;wxnode_internal_image&q;,&q;schema_version&q;:&q;1.2.0&q;,&q;links&q;:[],&q;align&q;:&q;none&q;,&q;assetid&q;:&q;07a593de-0d5f-4563-bb8a-df58d08d1a80&q;,&q;sizecode&q;:&q;large&q;,&q;credit&q;:&q;Michele Tantussi/Getty Images&q;,&q;linkurl&q;:&q;&q;,&q;synopsis&q;:&q;People pass by a billboard showing an image of Prussian explorer, geographer, and natural scientist Alexander von Humboldt at the entrance of the Humboldt University on April 3, 2019, in Berlin, Germany, as the nation commemorated the 250th anniversary of von Humboldt&s;s birth.

(Jim Pire)&l;/em&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;In the early summer of 2010, Dr. Perry Samson (meteorology professor at the University of Michigan (UM) in Ann Arbor and co-founder of Weather Underground) approached me with the proposition to begin blogging for Weather Underground as a result of my book &l;em&g;Extreme Weather: A Guide and Record Book&l;/em&g;, which he was using as an ancillary text for some of the courses he taught at UM. Perry introduced me to WU co-founder Dr. Jeff Masters, who was running the company at the time. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Jeff and I decided that I would become the company&a;rsquo;s &a;ldquo;weather historian&a;rdquo;, and I posted my first blog entry for WU in September 2010. For the first two years I blogged once a week, along with Jeff and Ricky Rood. Then, in late 2012 I picked up the pace and began posting three times weekly. This continued for the next few years until the end of 2014, when Bob Henson joined WU and took on the primary blogging responsibilities. This was a relief for me since I was finding it increasingly difficult to pen three blogs a week on historical weather events. Since then I gradually reduced my blogging from once a week to once a month, my pace for the past four years. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;All in all, I posted around 400 blogs for WU. As Category 6 is now winding down (see the &l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/cat6/end-of-an-era-category-6-to-close-shop-this-month\&q;&g;announcement post&l;/a&g; from June 10), this final post of mine consists of some of what I consider to have been my most interesting blogs over the course of the ten years I worked for Weather Underground.&l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn0\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;My fourth blog entry for WU, posted in October 2010, was probably the most influential:&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/blog/weatherhistorian/questions-concerning-the-world-record-1364f-58c-at-al-aziza-li.html\&q;&g;&l;strong&g;Questions Concerning the World Record 136.4&a;deg;F (58&a;deg;C) at Al Azizia, Libya&l;/strong&g;&l;/a&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;The images for this entry have been lost (sorry!). The post led to an official investigation of the record by the World Meteorological Organization. I was invited to be a member of this committee, along with a dozen other climatologists from around the world. The investigation resulted in the record being &l;a href=\&q;https://public.wmo.int/en/media/news/wmo-ninety-year-old-world-temperature-record-el-azizia-libya-invalid\&q;&g;officially overturned&l;/a&g;. The full committee report was simultaneously published in a &l;a href=\&q;https://journals.ametsoc.org/bams/article/94/2/199/60223/World-Meteorological-Organization-Assessment-of\&q;&g;BAMS article&l;/a&g; in February 2013. I blogged on &l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/blog/weatherhistorian/world-heat-record-overturneda-personal-account.html\&q;&g;this report&l;/a&g; (with images saved this time) in September 2012, when the WMO made its official proclamation. The story even made the front page of the New York Times on &l;a href=\&q;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/29/science/earth/death-valley-temperature-record-is-restored.html\&q;&g;December 29, 2012&l;/a&g;&a;mdash;my Andy Warhol &a;ldquo;fifteen minutes of fame&a;rdquo;!&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Weather Underground produced a feature documentary, &a;ldquo;Dead Heat&a;rdquo;, concerning the two-year long investigation. The documentary is actually more exciting than you might think. It was a professional production and covered not just one but two Libyan revolutions which had a part in the WMO investigation. In February 2011 Khalid El-Fadli, who was the director of Libya&a;rsquo;s meteorological service and a key member of the investigation, went missing for six-plus months. &a;rdquo;Dead Heat&a;rdquo; is 25 minutes long, but worth the effort to view. It&a;rsquo;s also the only feature documentary Weather Underground ever produced (we filmed in March-May 2012). At the end of the film I visit Death Valley, which by default became the new record-holder for hottest place on Earth. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&a;ldquo;Dead Heat&a;rdquo; can be viewed online &l;a href=\&q;https://vimeo.com/49493739\&q;&g;through Vimeo&l;/a&g;.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;In October 2016 I posted a blog entry, co-authored and researched by William Reid, concerning the Death Valley heat record featured in the last 10 minutes of the WU documentary mentioned above. Although I had concluded in &a;ldquo;Dead Heat&a;rdquo; that the Death Valley record from 1913 was most likely valid, I later reconsidered that verdict.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/blog/weatherhistorian/an-investigation-of-death-valleys-134f-world-temperature-record.html#:~:text=An%20Investigation%20of%20Death%20Valley&s;s%20134%C2%B0F%20World%20Temperature%20Record,-By%3A%20Christopher%20C&a;amp;text=In%202012%20the%20WMO%20(World,Libya%20on%20September%2013%2C%201922.\&q;&g;&l;strong&g;An Investigation of Death Valley&a;rsquo;s 134&a;deg;F World Temperature Record&l;/strong&g;&l;/a&g;&l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn1\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;As you can read in that 2016 entry, it was not meteorologically possible for the temperature to have reached 134&a;deg;F (56.7&a;deg;C) at the Greenland Ranch (now Furnace Creek) on July 13, 1913.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;The WMO is unwilling to revisit this old record, since they normally do not rehash old weather records (the Libyan investigation was unique). The WMO also feared going down a rabbit hole of investigating what the actual world heat record might be, since there are a number of would-be contenders. See, for instance, this entry I posted in July 2016 on the hottest temperature reports from around the world.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/blog/weatherhistorian/hottest-reliably-measured-air-temperatures-on-earth.html\&q;&g;&l;strong&g;Hottest Reliably Measured Air Temperatures on Earth&l;/strong&g;&l;/a&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;As you can read, William and I conclude with certainty that the actual hottest temperature ever reliably measured on Earth is 54&a;deg;C (129.2&a;deg;F), shared by Death Valley on June 30, 2013 and Mitribah, Kuwait on July 21, 2016. By the way, following this further investigation I now give the claimed Death Valley 1913 record a validity score of 0. You&a;rsquo;ll have to read the blog to understand what that means.&l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn2\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;Another entry of mine, posted in March 2015, did result in a new WMO investigation: the warmest temperature ever measured in Antarctica.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/blog/weatherhistorian/possible-new-continental-heat-record-for-antarctica.html\&q;&g;&l;strong&g;Possible New Continental Heat Record for Antarctica&l;/strong&g;&l;/a&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;The value of 17.5&a;deg;C (63.5&a;deg;F) was accepted by the WMO in 2015, although this record was &l;a href=\&q;https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/146322/antarctica-melts-under-its-hottest-days-on-record\&q;&g;broken again&l;/a&g; in February 2020.&l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn3\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;Yet another blog entry of mine, posted in March 2013, also resulted in a WMO investigation concerning what might be the wettest place on Earth. Across 31 complete years of data, the annual average precipitation at Puerto Lopez, Colombia, was an astonishing 13,466.3 mm (530.17&a;rdquo;).&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/blog/weatherhistorian/new-wettest-place-on-earth-discovered.html\&q;&g;&l;strong&g;New Wettest Place on Earth Discovered?&l;/strong&g;&l;/a&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;In this case the WMO came to the conclusion that there were a few too many months of precipitation data missing over the latest 30-year period of record (1981&a;ndash;2010) for Puerto Lopez, to be determined as officially the wettest location on Earth. Regardless of that, there is no question in my mind that Puerto Lopez is, in fact, the wettest location on Earth for which long-term data exists.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Along the lines of wettest locations around the world is the discovery of a site in Maui, Hawaii, that is likely the wettest location in North America. See this entry I posted in May 2012:&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/blog/weatherhistorian/new-wettest-location-for-the-usa-discovered.html\&q;&g;&l;strong&g;New Wettest Location for the U.S.A. Discovered?&l;/strong&g;&l;/a&g;&l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn4\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;Big Bog on Maui appears to be even wetter than Mt. Waialeale on Kauai according to research done by a team of scientists from the University of Hawai&s;i at M&a;#257;noa.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/blog/weatherhistorian/time-to-update-worlds-driest-and-wettest-locations.html\&q;&g;&l;strong&g;Time to Update World&a;rsquo;s Driest and Wettest Locations?&l;/strong&g;&l;/a&g;&l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn5\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;It is apparent that Quillagua, Chile (POR since 1964) is even drier than Arica, Chile, which is still, perhaps erroneously, listed by the WMO as the driest place on Earth. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Another likely world record I blogged about was that of the most rain to fall in a 1-minute period. This entry, posted in September 2013, uncovered an obscure paper published by a French government agency that detailed the event that occurred near Barot, Guadeloupe, on November 26, 1970.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/blog/weatherhistorian/worlds-greatest-1minute-precipitation-record.html\&q;&g;&l;strong&g;World&a;rsquo;s Greatest 1-Minute Precipitation Record&l;/strong&g;&l;/a&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;The evidence presented in this report for the a 1-minute rainfall of 1.50&a;rdquo; is just as detailed as the evidence for Unionville, Maryland&a;rsquo;s 1-minute record (1.23&a;rdquo; in 1-minute on July 4, 1956) which is considered the world record for such.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;On the subject of world weather records, I&a;rsquo;ve always been intrigued in barometric records. I posted a two-part entry in November 2011 on the highest and lowest barometric pressure records (reduced to sea level) measured in the U.S. and on Earth. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/blog/weatherhistorian/world-and-us-lowest-barometric-pressure-records.html\&q;&g;&l;strong&g;World and U.S. Lowest Barometric Pressure Records&l;/strong&g;&l;/a&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/blog/weatherhistorian/world-and-us-anticyclonic-high-barometric-pressure-records.html\&q;&g;&l;strong&g;World and U.S. Anti-Cyclonic (High Barometric) Pressure Records&l;/strong&g;&l;/a&g;&l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn6\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;It should be noted that the WMO investigated the Mongolian high-pressure record(s) and disallowed them due to the high elevation of the site.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;More recently (since a I began blogging just once a month and had more time for research) I posted several analyses of historical U.S. temperature, precipitation, and snowfall trends. These posts employed weeks of research. I used only sites with very long PORs, which differs from other similar analysis that incorporated more sites but shorter PORs.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Posted in May 2017:&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/cat6/us-daily-record-highs-outnumber-lows-5-1-2010\&q;&g;&l;strong&g;U.S. Daily Record Highs Outnumber Lows 5 to 1 since 2010&l;/strong&g;&l;/a&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;I was planning to update this data at the beginning of 2021 to see how the full decade of 2010-2019 eventually turns out. Alas, not to be.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Along the same line is this entry posted a bit later in October 2017 concerning the dramatic increase in average annual temperatures for cities across the U.S.:&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/cat6/dramatic-increase-annual-average-temperatures-us-cities-decade\&q;&g;&l;strong&g;A Dramatic Increase in Annual Average Temperatures for U.S. Cities This Decade&l;/strong&g;&l;/a&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Once again, I was planning to update this blog early next year (2021) when the new 30-year POR temperature data for the entire 1991-2020 POR becomes available.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;This year I posted two blogs (the snow one in January and the precipitation one in March) concerning decadal trends of snowfall and precipitation for a select but representative number of cities across the contiguous U.S. with POR&a;rsquo;s dating back to at least 1900.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/cat6/US-Snowfall-1900-2019-Decade-Decade-Look\&q;&g;&l;strong&g;U.S. Snowfall 1900-2019: A Decade-by Decade Look&l;/strong&g;&l;/a&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/cat6/us-precipitation-1901-2019-a-decade-by-decade-look\&q;&g;&l;strong&g;U.S. Precipitation 1901-2019: A Decade-by-Decade Look&l;/strong&g;&l;/a&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;There are some interesting conclusions, but they vary from considerably from one region to the next. Please view the posts for the details.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Another two-part entry, in October-November 2018, concerned what I considered some of the most anomalous weather events in U.S. history. This, of course, is a subjective list.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/cat6/Most-Unusual-Weather-Events-US-History-Part-1\&q;&g;&l;strong&g;The Most Anomalous Weather Events in U.S. History (Part 1)&l;/strong&g;&l;/a&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/cat6/Most-Anomalous-Weather-Events-US-History-Part-2\&q;&g;&l;strong&g;The Most Anomalous Weather Events in U.S. History (Part 2)&l;/strong&g;&l;/a&g;&l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn7\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;Last but not least, a fun entry from 2012:&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/blog/weatherhistorian/the-top-12-most-unusual-weatherrelated-photographs.html\&q;&g;&l;strong&g;The Top 12 Most Unusual Weather-Related Photographs&l;/strong&g;&l;/a&g;&l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn8\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;&l;strong&g;KUDOS: &l;/strong&g;As they say, all good things must come to an end, and so it is with sadness I say farewell to Weather Underground.

The coastal city of Arica has long been considered the single driest place of all averaging only .03” of precipitation a year. However, new research indicates that the site known as Quillagua (about 200 miles southeast of Arica) is even drier. For the 30-year POR of 1971–2000, there were only three rainfalls—.02” in June 1984, .01” in October 1984, and .04” in May 1992—meaning that the average annual rainfall for the site over this period was is a meager .005”. As of when the above entry was posted (March 2013), not a drop of rain had fallen there since 1992. I don&s;t know how long this dry spell persisted following March 2013, but the 21-year period of no measurable rain (from May 1992 until at least February 2013) is the longest such rainless period yet observed on Earth. The previous record was 14 years at Arica, where no rainfall was measured from October 1903 to January 1918.

NOAA rated May as tied with 2016 for warmest May on record, while NASA put May 2020 ahead of May 2016 by 0.06&a;deg;C. Minor differences in rankings often occur between NOAA and NASA, due to the different techniques they use to handle data-sparse regions such as the Arctic.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;The year-to-date period of January-May ranks as the second warmest such period on record, just 0.06&a;deg;C behind the record set in 2016. According to NCEI&s;s &l;a href=\&q;https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/global/202003/supplemental/page-2\&q;&g;outlook for annual temperature&l;/a&g;, the year 2020 has more than a 99.9% chance to rank among the five warmest years on record, and a 49% chance of being the warmest year on record. If so, each of the past seven years (including 2020) will have been among the seven warmest years on record.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;NASA classified May 2020 as having the 17th-highest monthly temperature departure from average for any month in the 1,684-month record, dating back to 1880: 1.02&a;deg;C (1.84&a;deg;F) above the 20th century average. All five months of 2020 rank in the top 20 for warmest of any month on record.&l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn0\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;Global temperature records are more likely to be set during the peak of the solar cycle--and during strong El Ni&a;ntilde;o events, due to the extra heat the tropical Pacific Ocean gives up to the atmosphere. The remarkable warmth of 2020 has come in the absence of an El Ni&a;ntilde;o event and during the minimum of one of the weakest 11-year solar cycles in the past century, underscoring the dominant role human-caused global warming has in heating our planet.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Global ocean temperatures during May 2020 were the second warmest on record, and global land temperatures were the warmest on record. Global satellite-measured temperatures in May 2020 for the lowest 8 km of the atmosphere were the second warmest or warmest in the 42-year record, according to the University of Alabama Huntsville (UAH) and Remote Sensing Systems, respectively.&l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn1\&q; /&g;&l;h2&g;&l;strong&g;Three billion-dollar weather disasters in May 2020; thirteen for the year&l;/strong&g;&l;/h2&g;&l;p&g;Three billion-dollar weather-related disasters hit the Earth last month, according to the May 2020 Catastrophe Report from insurance broker &l;a href=\&q;http://catastropheinsight.aonbenfield.com/Pages/Home.aspx\&q;&g;Aon&l;/a&g;: &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;1. Nine severe weather events hit China in May, affecting 26 provinces and killing 20 people. Damage was estimated at $1.1 billion.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;2. After peaking as a category 5 storm with 160 mph winds, a weakening &l;a href=\&q;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone_Amphan\&q;&g;Cyclone Amphan&l;/a&g; made landfall near the India/Bangladesh border as a category 2 storm with 100 mph winds. The cyclone triggered evacuations of 4.2 million people, and destroyed or damaged 2.8 million homes in India and 225,000 in Bangladesh. Amphan killed 133 people and left damages estimated at $15 billion, making it the most-costly Indian Ocean tropical cyclone in history. The large number of evacuations likely led to an increase in spread of Covid-19 in both India and Bangladesh.&l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn2\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;3. An extensive severe weather outbreak hit Texas and the Southeast U.S. on May 27 - 28. Supercells produced swaths of large and significant hail, notably near San Antonio, with hail up to 2.5 inches in diameter. Damaging winds hit the Houston metro area, with a gust of 65 mph (105 kph) reported in Harris County. Damage was expected to top $1 billion.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Through the end of May, Earth had seen 13 billion-dollar weather disasters for the year. The Australian wildfires span the boundary between 2019 and 2020, though, and may end up being classified as a 2019 disaster rather than a 2020 disaster. Three May severe weather outbreaks&a;mdash;two in the U.S., and one in Australia&a;mdash;had over $900 million in damage, and may end up being billion-dollar disasters once final damage tallies are available later in the year. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Here is the 2020 list of billion-dollar weather disasters, according to Aon:&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;1.

Over the past month, sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the benchmark Ni&a;ntilde;o3.4 region of the eastern tropical Pacific (5&a;deg;N-5&a;deg;S, 170&a;deg;W-120&a;deg;W) cooled, falling to 0.3&a;deg;C below-average. This is short of the 0.5&a;deg;C below-average threshold needed to be considered La Ni&a;ntilde;a conditions, though. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Forecasters at NOAA and the International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI) are calling for a roughly 60% chance of neutral conditions continuing through the Northern Hemisphere summer. They put the odds of a La Ni&a;ntilde;a forming during the autumn or winter at about 45 &a;ndash; 50%, about the same odds as neutral conditions for the period. For the August-September-October peak of the hurricane season, they put the odds of El Ni&a;ntilde;o at 6%, and the odds of a La Ni&a;ntilde;a event at 46% (a rise from the 30% chance given a month ago). Atlantic hurricane seasons tend to be much more active during La Ni&a;ntilde;a conditions than during El Ni&a;ntilde;o conditions, due to weaker upper-level winds creating lower amounts of wind shear. During La Ni&a;ntilde;a events, the U.S. East Coast from Georgia to Maine sees a significant increase in landfall frequency compared to ENSO-neutral years, according to a &l;a href=\&q;https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/JCLI4063.1\&q;&g;2007 paper&l;/a&g;.&l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn3\&q; /&g;&l;h2&g;&l;strong&g;Arctic sea ice: fourth lowest May extent on record&l;/strong&g;&l;/h2&g;&l;p&g;Arctic sea ice extent during May 2020 was the fourth lowest in the 42-year satellite record, according to the &l;a href=\&q;http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/\&q;&g;National Snow and Ice Data Center&l;/a&g; (NSIDC).

My blog is called &a;ldquo;&l;a href=\&q;https://www.yaleclimateconnections.org/eye-on-the-storm/\&q;&g;Eye on the Storm&l;/a&g;&a;rdquo;, and all of my posts to Yale Climate Connections can be found there. Bob Henson will also be a regular contributor to Yale Climate Connections.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;My first post analyzed three papers on the value of wetlands in reducing storm damage&a;mdash;and the unfortunate inevitable demise of much of these important wetlands. I anticipate making one or two posts per week there, and more frequent posts when there is a tropical cyclone worthy of attention. At present, there is no comments section, but the excellent staff of Yale Climate Connections has made it high priority to get a comments section up for my &a;ldquo;Eye on the Storm&a;rdquo; blog in the next few weeks. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;The Yale site has a long history of excellent reporting on climate change&a;mdash;check out their 2010 interview with me, &l;a href=\&q;https://www.yaleclimateconnections.org/2010/09/wundergroundcom-cofounder-jeff-masters/\&q;&g;Wunderground.com&a;rsquo;s Jeff Masters: From &a;lsquo;Mad Scientist Club&a;rsquo; to Leading Internet Site&l;/a&g;.

Activists and allies alike are strengthening calls for systemic change to U.S. policing practices, as well as to address longstanding racial inequities within science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Hundreds of scientists from various fields signed on to a &l;a href=\&q;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/06/researchers-around-world-prepare-shutdownstem-and-strike-black-lives\&q;&g;Strike for Black Lives&l;/a&g; (#strikeforblacklives) that took place on Wednesday, June 10. Organized by a group of 15 physicists, the strike had gathered &l;a href=\&q;https://www.particlesforjustice.org/\&q;&g;more than 5874 pledged participants&l;/a&g; from the research community as of noon EDT Wednesday.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&a;ldquo;We recognize that our academic institutions and research collaborations&a;mdash;despite big talk about diversity, equity, and inclusion&a;mdash;have ultimately failed Black people,&a;rdquo; said the organizers in a statement. &a;ldquo;Demands for justice have been met with gradualism and tokenism, as well as diversity and inclusion initiatives that&a;mdash;while sometimes well-intentioned&a;mdash;have had little meaningful impact on the lived experiences of Black students, staff, researchers, and faculty&a;hellip;.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&a;ldquo;Every single institution around the world can and should get involved in this work, and the strike marks an opportunity to recommit to the humanist values which should underpin academic work, including the belief that Black Lives Matter.&a;rdquo;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;In recent days, a number of scientific organizations have issued statements and calls to action on racial justice, several of which were noted in a &l;a href=\&q;https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2020/06/02/scientists-speak-out-against-racial-injustice-discrimination-amid-national-protests/\&q;&g;Capital Weather Gang article&l;/a&g;.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Mary Glackin, president of the 11,000-member &l;strong&g;American Meteorological Society (AMS)&l;/strong&g;, released a &l;a href=\&q;https://www.ametsoc.org/index.cfm/ams/about-ams/ams-statements/statements-of-the-ams-in-force/special-statement-on-racism-and-inequity/\&q;&g;Special Statement on Racism and Inequality&l;/a&g;. &a;ldquo;We acknowledge the pain our Black and African American community members are experiencing and hope our solidarity relieves a small part of the weight of that pain,&a;rdquo; Glackin said. &a;ldquo;In the AMS community, we promise to continue doing all we can to challenge and change systems of inequity that perpetuate racism and bias within our community.&a;rdquo; &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;The AMS Council, of which I&a;rsquo;m a member, voted last fall to establish a &l;a href=\&q;https://blog.ametsoc.org/news/amss-new-culture-and-inclusion-cabinet/\&q;&g;Culture and Inclusion Cabinet&l;/a&g;, a top-level activity with the charge to &a;ldquo;accelerate the integration of a culture of inclusion, belonging, diversity, equity, and accessibility across the AMS and evaluate and assess progress towards culture and inclusion strategic goals within the Society.&a;rdquo;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Sudip Parikh, chief executive officer of the 120,000-member&l;strong&g; American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS)&l;/strong&g;, emphasized in &l;a href=\&q;https://www.aaas.org/news/aaas-ceo-comments-social-unrest-racism-and-inequality\&q;&g;comments&l;/a&g; on June 1 that &a;ldquo;science, scientists, and science advocates are going to be critical to ensuring we successfully navigate this troubled time together&a;rdquo; and called for recommitting AAAS to a set of relevant principles:&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&a;bull; Diversity, equity, and inclusion along every axis are critical for our organization, the scientific enterprise, and our community to progress&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&a;bull; Ensuring lasting diversity, equity, and inclusion requires going beyond intervention to systemic change&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&a;bull; Systemic change begins with everyone feeling safe and respected&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&a;bull; Hatred, discrimination, and injustice have no place at AAAS, in science, or in our community&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&a;ldquo;Like the rest of the world, when we watched the horrific killing of George Floyd, we were filled with a range of emotions, from anger to grief,&a;rdquo; said a group of four past and present leaders of the&l;strong&g; American Geophysical Union (AGU)&l;/strong&g; in a statement on 31 May. &a;ldquo;We also knew that the injustice and discrimination that we saw would be felt beyond Minnesota&a;hellip;.Tragically, this is only the latest example of a systematic problem of rules, laws and cultures created so that some individuals are not encouraged or supported to thrive or even survive.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&a;ldquo;We, an organization of 130,000 in Earth and space sciences, are working for equity for all as well as ensuring all cultures and institutions are more inclusive and diverse throughout our communities. We know that when we have a diverse and inclusive research community and workplace, we will find better solutions to major problems, like the climate crisis. We are geoscientists, and we are eager to work with others to solve societal challenges to meet the needs of populations around the globe. We have already removed some barriers within our community to be more diverse and inclusive, yet we know we have more work to do. Rest assured that this remains one of our key priorities until injustices and inequalities are eliminated.&a;rdquo;&l;/p&g;&l;h2&g;&l;strong&g;Listen, Act, Lead: A call from geoscientists&l;/strong&g;&l;/h2&g;&l;p&g;A group of ten scholars, primarily geoscientists of color in academia, have put together a comprehensive set of proposals published under the heading &l;a href=\&q;https://notimeforsilence.org/\&q;&g;A Call to Action for an Anti-Racist Science Community from Geoscientists of Color: Listen, Act, Lead&l;/a&g;.  Several of them are atmospheric scientists. The document includes specific calls to action for entities that include NOAA, the National Science Foundation, federal agencies such as NASA and EPA, and federally funded research and development centers such as the National Center for Atmospheric Research. It stresses:&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&a;ldquo;The time has passed for hand-wringing and inert sympathies. The time has passed for predominantly white scientific organizations to post photos of happy, multiracial groups on their websites in place of actually diversifying their leadership and members. The time has passed for academic units to use images of their isolated Black student/postdoc/faculty member to project more racial harmony than actually exists. The time also has passed for letting a misplaced sense of politeness silence our anguish. It is neither a time for reactive posturing nor the tired responses of &a;lsquo;more research is needed&a;rsquo; and &a;lsquo;this is a difficult problem.&a;rsquo; We are scientists. Solving difficult problems is what we do.&a;rdquo;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;I invited two of my colleagues on the AMS Council who are part of the &a;ldquo;Listen, Act, Lead&a;rdquo; initiative&a;mdash;Dr. Melissa Burt (Colorado State University) and Dr. Vernon Morris (Arizona State University)&a;mdash;to weigh in with their experience and perspective. &l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn0\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;&a;ldquo;This moment has been incredibly exhausting, frustrating, triggering and, at times, isolating. I&a;rsquo;ve had my moments of feeling alone,&a;rdquo; said Burt, who is a research scientist at CSU&a;rsquo;s Department of Atmospheric Science and Assistant Dean for Diversity and Inclusion at CSU&a;rsquo;s Walter Scott, Jr. College of Engineering, in an email. &a;ldquo;In contributing to &a;lsquo;Listen. Act. Lead,&a;rsquo; I&a;rsquo;ve also felt empowered to continue to make our voices heard, to make the community value our voice, to make our community truly see us. These aren&a;rsquo;t new experiences as Black people in America, in STEM and in the geoscience community.&a;rdquo;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;While in college, Burt participated in the &l;a href=\&q;https://soars.ucar.edu/\&q;&g;SOARS Program&l;/a&g;, an undergraduate-to-graduate bridge program based at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research. (I had the great pleasure of serving as a SOARS mentor for several years during my time at UCAR.) &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&a;ldquo;The exposure to the research enterprise that SOARS provided many people of color has been impactful, and their foundational mentoring model is one that has been replicated in a number of places,&a;rdquo; said Burt. &a;ldquo;Replicating best practices not only from SOARS, but other &l;a href=\&q;https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/\&q;&g;REU&l;/a&g; programs (Research Experiences for Undergraduates) and &l;a href=\&q;https://hbculifestyle.com/list-of-hbcu-schools/\&q;&g;HBCUs&l;/a&g; (Historically Black Colleges and Universities) would be a great success. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&a;ldquo;I think we can look to many of the current and forthcoming leaders who have passed these programs to see what new approaches rise up. My successes, along with my leadership experience, are due in part to my SOARS experience, which helped to launch my network of incredible scientists, colleagues, and friends.&a;rdquo;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;As the founding lead of the AMS Culture and Inclusion Cabinet, Burt looks forward to looking deeply and strategically at how the AMS is evolving. &a;ldquo;How do we integrate and weave a culture of inclusion, belonging, diversity, equity, and accessibility across the AMS, and how can we disseminate this to the broader atmospheric science community?&a;rdquo;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Morris, a chemistry professor and researcher at Howard University and Director of Howard&a;rsquo;s atmospheric science program, has carried out extensive field work on atmospheric aerosols and chemistry while also launching several major outreach programs, including a series of NOAA-sponsored &l;a href=\&q;http://ncas.howard.edu/outreach-programs/weather-camp/\&q;&g;CAREERS Weather Camps&l;/a&g; for high school students. Nearly 70% of participants have been Black, Latinx, Indigenous, or Asian/Pacific Islander. (See the &l;a href=\&q;https://chalkdustmagazine.com/black-mathematician-month/conversation-vernon-morris/\&q;&g;2017 profile&l;/a&g; in Chalkdust magazine for more on Morris&a;rsquo;s life and work.)&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&a;ldquo;I am emotionally exhausted,&a;rdquo; Morris said in an email. &a;ldquo;It is hard to express the frustration, trauma, and pain that magnified over the last two weeks.  While it is a sort of &a;lsquo;unveiling&a;rsquo; of racism for much of the white community, it is a profoundly painful reminder of racism for the Black community that tears open old wounds and threatens multi-generational destruction of lives, dreams, and destinies.&a;rdquo;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Morris has participated in civil rights efforts since his teens, including voter education drives in south Georgia, anti-apartheid protests in Atlanta, and environmental justice initiatives and anti-Klan rallies in Washington, DC. After 25 years at Howard, he will soon start a new position at Arizona State University as the Director of the School of Mathematical and Natural Sciences at the New College of Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences.  He is also putting his energy into other forms of activism, including working on the &a;ldquo;Listen, Act, Lead&a;rdquo; effort as well as serving on boards and councils that might influence policy. (Along with the AMS Council, Morris is a member of the AGU Diversity and Inclusion Advisory Council.) &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&a;ldquo;The energy and activity of direct action draws and inspires me,&a;rdquo; he said, &a;ldquo;but I feel that my greater contribution is now in other forms of strategically targeting power.&a;rdquo; &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Along with Burt, Morris points to the development and strengthening of science programs at Howard and other HBCUs as one major step forward in the last 10 to 20 years. A group of just six HBCUs have produced the majority of Latinx and African American talent entering the atmospheric sciences in the last few years, Morris said. &a;ldquo;If those models were propagated, there would be a sea change,&a;rdquo; he added. Programs such as the CAREERS weather camps for high school students are also vital, said Morris.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&a;ldquo;New approaches are needed, but we should also be sustaining, extending, and translating some of the best practices from these successes.&a;rdquo;&l;/p&g;&l;h2&g;&l;strong&g;IBM speaks out&l;/strong&g;&l;/h2&g;&l;p&g;In a letter to Congress on Monday, IBM chief executive officer Arvind Krishna launched the first step in an IBM push for public policy changes to advance racial justice and combat systemic racism. &a;ldquo;We realize these measures are only a beginning,&a;rdquo; Krishna wrote, &a;ldquo;but IBM wants to help advance this nation&s;s pursuit of equity and justice and we stand ready to work with you to advance policies that will help unify our country and advance our national purpose.&a;rdquo;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;The letter conveyed IBM&a;rsquo;s interest in working with Congress in three areas:&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;strong&g;&a;mdash;Police reform: &l;/strong&g;new federal rules should hold police more accountable for misconduct&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;strong&g;&a;mdash;Responsible technology policies: &l;/strong&g;technology can increase transparency and help police protect communities but must not promote discrimination or racial injustice&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;strong&g;&a;mdash;Expanding opportunity:&l;/strong&g; training and education for in-demand skills is key to expanding economic opportunity for communities of color&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;The letter noted that IBM &l;a href=\&q;https://apnews.com/5ee4450df46d2d96bf85d7db683bb0a6\&q;&g;no longer offers general-purpose facial recognition or analysis software&l;/a&g;, a technology found to be &l;a href=\&q;https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/19/tech/facial-recognition-study-racial-bias/index.html\&q;&g;prone to widespread racial bias&l;/a&g;. &a;ldquo;IBM firmly opposes and will not condone uses of any technology, including facial recognition technology offered by other vendors, for mass surveillance, racial profiling, violations of basic human rights and freedoms, or any purpose which is not consistent with our values and Principles of Trust and Transparency. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&a;ldquo;We believe now is the time to begin a national dialogue on whether and how facial recognition technology should be employed by domestic law enforcement agencies.&a;rdquo;&l;/p&g;\n&q;,&q;wxnodes&q;:[{&q;id&q;:&q;wxn0&q;,&q;type&q;:&q;wxnode_internal_image&q;,&q;schema_version&q;:&q;1.2.0&q;,&q;links&q;:[],&q;align&q;:&q;none&q;,&q;assetid&q;:&q;a857fb24-cd98-41e4-9fc7-7c6fcee27d18&q;,&q;sizecode&q;:&q;large&q;,&q;credit&q;:&q;&q;,&q;linkurl&q;:&q;&q;,&q;synopsis&q;:&q;Dr. Melissa Burt (left) and Dr. Vernon Morris (right).&q;}],&q;summary&q;:&q;Atmospheric scientists and other geoscientists are calling for sustained action to address inequities.&q;,&q;primary_image&q;:{&q;uri&q;:&q;https://s.w-x.co/embrace-930px.jpg&q;,&q;title&q;:&q;Black Lives Matter—In Science and Everywhere Else&q;,&q;alt&q;:&q;Black Lives Matter—In Science and Everywhere Else&q;},&q;secondary_image&q;:{&q;uri&q;:&q;https://s.w-x.co/embrace-930px.jpg&q;,&q;title&q;:&q;Black Lives Matter—In Science and Everywhere Else&q;,&q;alt&q;:&q;Black Lives Matter—In Science and Everywhere Else&q;},&q;disclaimer&q;:&q;news&q;},{&q;id&q;:&q;8aafb3ad-8cd4-415f-908d-ec0de3dca724&q;,&q;schema_version&q;:&q;1.2.0&q;,&q;type&q;:&q;blog&q;,&q;url&q;:&q;/cat6/end-of-an-era-category-6-to-close-shop-this-month&q;,&q;locale&q;:&q;en_US&q;,&q;assetName&q;:&q;/cat6/end-of-an-era-category-6-to-close-shop-this-month&q;,&q;title&q;:&q; End of An Era: Category 6 to Close Shop This Month&q;,&q;publishdate&q;:&q;2020-06-09T22:22:42.000-04:00&q;,&q;lastmodifieddate&q;:&q;2020-06-10T11:27:24.000-04:00&q;,&q;user&q;:[{&q;id&q;:&q;d14af1e9-d888-493e-abba-492a20e3a2eb&q;,&q;name&q;:&q;Bob Henson&q;,&q;fullName&q;:&q;Bob Henson&q;,&q;bioUrl&q;:&q;/bios/news/2018-08-21-bob-henson&q;}],&q;tags&q;:{&q;keyword&q;:[&q;miscellaneous&q;,&q;2020&q;,&q;06&q;],&q;category&q;:&q;Miscellaneous&q;},&q;body&q;:&q;&l;p&g;&l;strong&g;&l;em&g;Above: &l;/em&g;&l;/strong&g;&l;em&g;A NOAA satellite image of Hurricane Katrina approaching the Gulf Coast at 2115Z (5:15 pm EDT) on August 28, 2005.

When he launched this wunderground blog in 2005, Jeff established a high bar for accessible discussion of tropical cyclones, and eventually many other spheres of weather and climate. I learned a vast amount working with Jeff through his &l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/cat6/Jeff-Masters-Leaving-Weather-Underground-November\&q;&g;departure in the fall of 2019&l;/a&g; (see my &l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/cat6/Bon-Voyage-Masters-Cat-6-One-and-Only-Jeff\&q;&g;tribute to Jeff&l;/a&g;) and I hope I&a;rsquo;ve met his high standards in keeping things going since then. I&a;rsquo;ve also learned a great deal from the insights contributed by our pool of regular commenters. I am especially glad we&a;rsquo;ve been able to give voice to the reality and gravity of human-caused climate change, and to stress society&a;rsquo;s ability to turn the ship around&a;mdash;a task that&a;rsquo;s incredibly daunting but not yet impossible.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;I am also happy to announce that you will be able to follow Jeff and me &l;a href=\&q;https://www.yaleclimateconnections.org/2020/06/jeff-masters-bob-henson-to-post-regularly-for-ycc/\&q;&g;at a new home&l;/a&g;. Jeff has agreed to take a new volunteer gig writing for the prestigious website &l;a href=\&q;https://www.yaleclimateconnections.org/\&q;&g;Yale Climate Connections&l;/a&g;. His &a;ldquo;Eye on the Storm&a;rdquo; blog begins there today (\&q;&l;a href=\&q;https://www.yaleclimateconnections.org/2020/06/sea-level-rise-likely-to-swallow-many-coastal-mangrove-forests/\&q;&g;Sea-level rise likely to swallow many coastal mangrove forests&l;/a&g;\&q;) and he plans to perform his usual daily updates on Atlantic disturbances and named storms during the heat of the hurricane season. &a;ldquo;Eye on the Storm&a;rdquo; does not yet have a comment section, but that will get added in a few weeks (with our current moderators coming along for the ride!). The Yale Climate Connections site is transitioning to a new content management software system that will require tweaking to establish a commenting system like the current WU system. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;I expect to be helping Jeff out at &a;ldquo;Eye on the Storm&a;rdquo; during big hurricanes, and I plan to contribute feature articles to Yale Climate Connections as well. You can also follow me on Twitter at @bhensonweather. Here&s;s an &l;a href=\&q;https://www.yaleclimateconnections.org/2020/06/jeff-masters-bob-henson-to-post-regularly-for-ycc/\&q;&g;announcement&l;/a&g; from YCC.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Weather Underground is not going away. The Weather Company, an IBM Business, which includes WU and &l;a href=\&q;http://weather.com/\&q;&g;weather.com&l;/a&g;, remains committed to advancing weather science and technology and covering the science behind climate and weather. I&s;ve enjoyed contributing to &l;a href=\&q;http://weather.com/\&q;&g;weather.com&l;/a&g; and working with my meteorologist and journalist colleagues on that excellent team over the last several years.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;As you all know, there is no place quite like Category 6 in the weather world. Our loyal commenters and our fearless, incredibly dedicated team of moderators have kept the Disqus feed humming 24/7. When Jeff departed last fall, we discovered just how many people were inspired to study meteorology and/or launch careers in the weather/climate realm after following the posts and joining the commentary here. It&a;rsquo;s so gratifying to know that Category 6 has made a difference in so many lives. I look forward to following that legacy in the great things to be accomplished by Cat 6 alumni. To cite just one example, Levi Cowan (@tropicaltidbits), who created the invaluable tropicaltidbits.com modeling site, is now on staff at the NOAA/AOML Hurricane Research Division. I&a;rsquo;m also happy that we have served as a congenial meeting spot for weather enthusiasts from around the world (literally!).&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;A million thanks to all of you all for following our musings, explanations, speculations, and occasional goofiness all these years. A special thanks goes to our guest bloggers through the years&a;mdash;particularly the irreplaceable WU weather historian Christopher Burt (whose must-have book &l;em&g;Extreme Weather&l;/em&g; is still available in its second edition)&a;mdash;and to our other colleagues who keep track of weather records around the world and have lent invaluable insights to Category 6, especially Maximiliano Herrera.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Please keep the positive dialogue going, however and wherever that might be. The world needs more people reaching across barriers and disciplines and finding common ground. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Take care and stay safe, everyone.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Bob&l;/p&g;\n&q;,&q;wxnodes&q;:[],&q;summary&q;:&q;The long-running blog will post its final entry in June.&q;,&q;primary_image&q;:{&q;uri&q;:&q;https://s.w-x.co/katrina-noaa-930px.jpg&q;,&q;title&q;:&q; End of An Era: Category 6 to Close Shop This Month&q;,&q;alt&q;:&q; End of An Era: Category 6 to Close Shop This Month&q;},&q;secondary_image&q;:{&q;uri&q;:&q;https://s.w-x.co/katrina-noaa-930px.jpg&q;,&q;title&q;:&q; End of An Era: Category 6 to Close Shop This Month&q;,&q;alt&q;:&q; End of An Era: Category 6 to Close Shop This Month&q;},&q;disclaimer&q;:&q;opinion&q;},{&q;id&q;:&q;41057eff-31af-44a7-ab31-cdea458c33e7&q;,&q;schema_version&q;:&q;1.2.0&q;,&q;type&q;:&q;blog&q;,&q;url&q;:&q;/cat6/cristobal-makes-a-beeline-for-midwest-rockies-slammed-by-a-rare-derecho&q;,&q;locale&q;:&q;en_US&q;,&q;assetName&q;:&q;/cat6/cristobal-makes-a-beeline-for-midwest-rockies-slammed-by-a-rare-derecho&q;,&q;title&q;:&q;Cristobal Makes a Beeline for Midwest; Rockies Slammed by a Rare Derecho&q;,&q;publishdate&q;:&q;2020-06-08T17:48:19.000-04:00&q;,&q;lastmodifieddate&q;:&q;2020-06-08T18:19:14.000-04:00&q;,&q;user&q;:[{&q;id&q;:&q;d14af1e9-d888-493e-abba-492a20e3a2eb&q;,&q;name&q;:&q;Bob Henson&q;,&q;fullName&q;:&q;Bob Henson&q;,&q;bioUrl&q;:&q;/bios/news/2018-08-21-bob-henson&q;}],&q;tags&q;:{&q;keyword&q;:[&q;hurricanes_typhoons_cyclones&q;,&q;2020&q;,&q;06&q;],&q;category&q;:&q;Hurricanes, Typhoons &a; Cyclones&q;},&q;body&q;:&q;&l;p&g;&l;strong&g;&l;em&g;Above:&l;/em&g;&l;/strong&g;&l;em&g; Rudy Horvath hands a piece of wood up to his wife Dawn Horvath, as their home, a boathouse in the West End section of New Orleans, takes on water a from storm surge in Lake Pontchartrain in advance of Tropical Storm Cristobal on Sunday, June 7, 2020. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert)&l;/em&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Tropical Depression Cristobal was working its way northward through Arkansas on Monday afternoon, gradually spinning down while still dumping noteworthy rainfall. The storm dropped 5&a;rdquo; to 10&a;rdquo; of rain across southeast Louisiana, far southern Mississippi and Alabama, and northern Florida. Some 24-hour totals from &l;a href=\&q;https://www.cocorahs.org/ViewData/ListDailyPrecipReports.aspx\&q;&g;CoCoRaHS&l;/a&g; volunteers through Monday morning included 9.17&a;rdquo; near Mandeville, LA; 7.10&a;rdquo; northwest of Pass Christian, MS; 6.45&a;rdquo; near Mobile, AL; and 7.17&a;rdquo; at White Springs, FL.&l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn0\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;Thus far, Cristobal&a;rsquo;s damage has been relatively modest. Winds at landfall were not extreme, and the rains have fallen largely atop ground that was drier-than-average. The highest-impact storm surge was limited to far southeast Louisiana on Sunday, and waters remained high in some areas on Monday. &l;a href=\&q;https://weather.com/storms/hurricane/news/2020-06-08-tropical-depression-cristobal-louisiana-mississippi-flooding-power\&q;&g;According to weather.com&l;/a&g;, 29 people were rescued from cabins on stilts that were surrounded by persistent high water at Fontainebleu State Park near Mandeville, on the north side of Lake Pontchartrain. Widespread flooding was also reported in low-lying Grande Isle, LA.&l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn1\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;In Florida, tornadoes were confirmed in Cristobal&a;rsquo;s rainbands on Saturday near Orlando and on Sunday south of Lake City. The NOAA/NWS Storm Prediction Center database showed 15 preliminary tornado reports related to Cristobal for &l;a href=\&q;https://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/200606_rpts_filtered.gif\&q;&g;Saturday&l;/a&g; and &l;a href=\&q;https://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/200607_rpts_filtered.gif\&q;&g;Sunday&l;/a&g;, all of them in Florida.&l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn2\&q; /&g;&l;h2&g;&l;strong&g;Will Cristobal become the Atlantic&a;rsquo;s first post-tropical cyclone to reach the heart of Wisconsin?&l;/strong&g;&l;/h2&g;&l;p&g;Flooding will remain a concern as Cristobal and its slug of exceptionally rich moisture accelerate northward. Fortunately, the system&a;rsquo;s quickening pace will help reduce the higher-end possibilities. Flash flood watches extended from Louisiana to Wisconsin as of Monday afternoon. In its &l;a href=\&q;https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/qpf/ero.php?opt=curr&a;amp;day=2\&q;&g;Day 2 outlook&l;/a&g; for Tuesday, the NWS/NOAA Weather Prediction Center had an expansive slight-risk area for excessive rain leading to potential flash flooding, stretching from eastern Nebraska to Upper Michigan.&l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn3\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;Cristobal is being pulled northward ahead of a strong midlatitude cyclone pushing across the Northern Plains. Tropical cyclones and their remnants typically recurve well before they get to the Upper Midwest as identifiable centers, but NHC is predicting that Cristobal will move across the length of Wisconsin as a post-tropical cyclone on Tuesday night. It may actually reintensify slightly as it comes under the influence of the approaching upper-level storm system and heads into Ontario. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Only three systems from the Atlantic have been known to reach Wisconsin as identifiable post-tropical cyclones. Two of them were catastrophic events during their respective landfalls: the &l;a href=\&q;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1900_Galveston_hurricane\&q;&g;Galveston hurricane of 1900&l;/a&g; and &l;a href=\&q;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Gilbert\&q;&g;Hurricane Gilbert&l;/a&g; of 1988. As shown below, all three of these hurricanes only managed to nick the southeastern corner of Wisconsin as post-tropical cyclones, so Cristobal will certainly carve a path in state history if it transects the state, even if its sustained winds are only in the 25-35 mph range. &l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn4\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;The 12Z Monday run of the GFS model predicted that precipitable water (the amount of moisture in an imaginary column above the surface) could set a June record over Milwaukee on Tuesday night as Cristobal passes by, with values possibly topping 2.20&a;rdquo;. (We should note that hurricanes from the Northeast Pacific often contribute into high-impact rainstorms across the Southern Plains, and sometimes their moisture makes it all the way to the Midwest.)&l;/p&g;&l;h2&g;&l;strong&g;Cristobal&a;rsquo;s place in climatology&l;/strong&g;&l;/h2&g;&l;p&g;Cristobal was the earliest &a;ldquo;C&a;rdquo; storm in any year of Atlantic hurricane records going back to 1851, and the second tropical storm to make landfall in the U.S. this year, following marginal Tropical Storm Bertha. Cristobal was also the second earliest tropical storm or hurricane landfall in Louisiana on record. No other year before 2020 has seen two tropical-cyclone landfalls confirmed on U.S. shores by June 7, according to Phil Klotzbach (Colorado State University). However, he is not confident that Cristobal would have been classified as a tropical system at landfall prior to the satellite era. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Klotzbach also points out that records prior to 1900 may not include some tropical storm landfalls because smaller populations along the Gulf and southeast Atlantic coasts. &a;ldquo;While we probably didn&s;t miss hurricanes, we certainly could have missed weaker tropical storms,&a;rdquo; said Klotzbach in an email.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;More than 20 forecast groups have concluded that we&a;rsquo;re likely to have a busier-than-average hurricane season (see the &l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/cat6/now-a-depression-cristobal-still-expected-to-reach-us-gulf-coast-as-tropical-storm\&q;&g;end of our post&l;/a&g; from last Thursday), based on variables such as already-warm sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic and the apparent shift in the tropical Pacific toward La Ni&a;ntilde;a. However, it would be wrong to assume that we&a;rsquo;re in for an active season simply because it&a;rsquo;s gotten off to an unusually busy start, as pointed out by Klotzbach in the tweet below.&l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn5\&q; /&g;&l;h2&g;&l;strong&g;The latest U.S. derecho hits the Central Rockies and High Plains&l;/strong&g;&l;/h2&g;&l;p&g;The nation&a;rsquo;s highest wind gusts in recent days didn&s;t occur with Cristobal. Instead, they&a;rsquo;ve been generated by multiple derechos&a;mdash;long-lasting corridors of downburst wind generated by intense thunderstorms. One derecho plowed &l;a href=\&q;https://weather.com/news/news/2020-06-03-storm-damage-impacts-pennsylvania-new-jersey\&q;&g;from eastern Pennsylvania across New Jersey&l;/a&g; on Wednesday, June 3, causing three fatalities and knocking out power to more than half a million people. Wind gusted to 89 mph at Long Beach Island on the New Jersey coast.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;A more unusual derecho, geographically speaking, blasted from Utah across southern Wyoming and Colorado into western Nebraska, South Dakota, and North Dakota on Saturday. It was generated by an unusually strong, cold upper-level storm pushing in from the Pacific Northwest and encountering much hotter air near the surface. &l;a href=\&q;This%20may%20be%20the%20first%20legitimate%20%2522derecho%2522%20to%20impact%20Colorado%20-%20at%20least%20the%20first%20one%20since%20reliable%20records%20became%20available%20in%20the%20mid-20th%20century.\&q;&g;According to the Colorado Climate Center&l;/a&g;, &a;ldquo;This may be the first legitimate \&q;derecho\&q; to impact Colorado&a;mdash;at least the first one since reliable records became available in the mid-20th century.&a;rdquo;&l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn6\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;As the intense squall line &l;a href=\&q;https://www.weather.gov/bou/June6th2020WindEvent\&q;&g;roared through Colorado&l;/a&g;, winds gusted at higher elevations to 110 mph near Winter Park and 90 mph just east of Copper Mountain. Gusts hit 78 mph at Denver International Airport as the derecho blew through. The storms prompted the &l;a href=\&q;https://twitter.com/russ_schumacher/status/1269378544213168128\&q;&g;two largest severe thunderstorm warnings&l;/a&g; (by far) issued by the NWS/Boulder office in records going back to 2007. &l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn7\&q; /&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn8\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;The derecho went on to spawn dramatic cloud formations across western South Dakota, as well as two brief tornadoes, confirmed by the NWS office in Rapid City.

As well predicted by models, Cristobal has been right-weighted, with the weather far more active on its right-hand (east) side than on its left-hand (west) side. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;What&a;rsquo;s interesting from a modeling perspective is that several models, including the GFS and HWRF, successfully captured the idea that Cristobal would have a vortex-within-a-vortex structure. The most distinct area of low-level spin approached the Louisiana coast on Sunday while rotating around the north side of a broader area of circulation. Meanwhile, another area of low-level spin was evident moving eastward around the south side of Cristobal&a;rsquo;s larger circulation, a bit further offshore (see visible satellite image below). In its 2 PM advisory, NHC appeared to place the center of Cristobal in between these small-scale vortexes, near the center of the broader circulation.  &l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn1\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;Cristobal&a;rsquo;s large size and unorthodox structure, along with a profusion of dry air in the western Gulf of Mexico, kept the storm from strengthening significantly atop warm sea-surface temperatures across the Gulf of Mexico. That large size also fostered a powerful band of showers and thunderstorms (convection) that pushed across western and northern Florida. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;One thunderstorm spawned a &l;a href=\&q;https://twitter.com/NWSMelbourne/status/1269461256424968193\&q;&g;confirmed tornado&l;/a&g; in the Orlando area on Saturday evening. More tornadoes are possible Sunday afternoon and evening northeast of Cristobal&a;rsquo;s center, especially over far southern Mississippi and Alabama, where a &l;a href=\&q;https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/ww0266.html\&q;&g;tornado watch&l;/a&g; was in effect until 5 pm CDT.&l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn2\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;Rainfall totals of 4&a;rdquo; &a;ndash; 6&a;rdquo; for the 24-hour period ending Sunday morning were widespread across Pinellas County in the Tampa Bay area, and a 24-hour total of 7.02&a;rdquo; was reported late Sunday morning at a &l;a href=\&q;http://cocorahs.org/\&q;&g;CoCoRaHS site&l;/a&g; about seven miles west of Jacksonville.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Tropical-storm-force sustained winds were limited to areas off the coast of southeast Louisiana as of early afternoon Sunday. Winds were sustained at 51 mph and gusting to 57 mph at a height of 53 meters (173 feet) at an &l;a href=\&q;http://weather.rap.ucar.edu/surface/index.php?metarIds=KVOA&a;amp;hoursStr=past+4+hours&a;amp;std_trans=translated&a;amp;num_metars=number&a;amp;submit_metars=Retrieve\&q;&g;offshore platform&l;/a&g; about 100 miles south of Mobile, Alabama.  &l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn3\&q; /&g;&l;h2&g;&l;strong&g;Floodwaters push into the Mississippi Delta&l;/strong&g; &l;/h2&g;&l;p&g;As expected, storm surge on Cristobal&a;rsquo;s right-hand side was extensive but not severe in most areas. One exception was in vulnerable far southeast Louisiana and southern Mississippi, just northeast of Cristobal&a;rsquo;s center. Storm surge at &l;a href=\&q;https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/stationhome.html?id=8761305\&q;&g;Shell Beach, Louisiana&l;/a&g;, reached 5.3&a;rsquo; and water levels reached 7.0&a;rsquo; above mean lower low water (MLLW) around 2:30 pm EDT Sunday.

At midday Sunday, the NOAA/NWS Weather Prediction Center issued a &l;a href=\&q;https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/qpf/ero.php?opt=curr&a;amp;day=1\&q;&g;high risk&l;/a&g; of excessive rain leading to flash floods across this area from Sunday afternoon into early Monday.

A corridor of 2&a;rdquo; &a;ndash; 5&a;rdquo; rains can be expected from Arkansas and Missouri into Iowa and Wisconsin, and some of Cristobal&a;rsquo;s moisture will help fuel additional heavy rain into northern Minnesota. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;WPC has a moderate risk of excessive rain/flash flooding on Monday from southern Mississippi to eastern Arkansas, with the possibility of training/persistent rainbands across at least some of this area.&l;/p&g;\n&q;,&q;wxnodes&q;:[{&q;id&q;:&q;wxn0&q;,&q;type&q;:&q;wxnode_twitter&q;,&q;schema_version&q;:&q;1.2.0&q;,&q;twitter_widget&q;:{&q;embed_text&q;:&q;https://twitter.com/NWSNewOrleans/status/1269682317653446656&q;,&q;type&q;:&q;tweet&q;,&q;embed_options&q;:{&q;handle&q;:&q;NWSNewOrleans&q;,&q;tweet_id&q;:&q;1269682317653446656&q;}},&q;caption&q;:&q;&q;},{&q;id&q;:&q;wxn1&q;,&q;type&q;:&q;wxnode_internal_image&q;,&q;schema_version&q;:&q;1.2.0&q;,&q;links&q;:[],&q;align&q;:&q;none&q;,&q;assetid&q;:&q;f3dba304-2a92-4da2-bcd1-b260e551a756&q;,&q;sizecode&q;:&q;large&q;,&q;credit&q;:&q;tropicaltidbits.com&q;,&q;linkurl&q;:&q;&q;,&q;synopsis&q;:&q;Visible high-resolution satellite image of Tropical Storm Cristobal at 1747Z (1:47 pm EDT) on Sunday, June 7, 2020.

On its expected course, Cristobal will make landfall Sunday afternoon or evening, most likely over or near southeast Louisiana. As it approaches, Cristobal will pull heavy rain, high surf, and storm surge well to the east of its center across the Gulf Coasts of Mississippi, Alabama and Florida.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;a href=\&q;https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT3+shtml/061448.shtml?\&q;&g;As of 2 pm EDT&l;/a&g;, Cristobal was centered about 310 miles south of the mouth of the Mississippi River, moving north at 12 mph. Cristobal&a;rsquo;s top sustained winds were 50 mph. A tropical storm warning was in effect from Intracoastal City, Louisiana, to the Okaloosa/Walton county line in the Florida Panhandle, including lakes Ponchartrain and Maurepas. A storm surge warning extended from the mouth of the Mississippi River in southeast Louisiana east to Ocean Springs, Mississippi, including Lake Borgne.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Mandatory evacuations were in effect for Grande Isle and lower Lafourche Parish, Louisiana, with voluntary evacuations increasing elsewhere in Louisiana, &l;a href=\&q;https://www.nola.com/news/weather/article_b5d5a398-a81c-11ea-a2e1-6fc54698f840.html\&q;&g;according to NOLA.com&l;/a&g;.

Yet as expected&a;mdash;and in a mode very typical of early-season tropical storms in the Gulf&a;mdash;Cristobal is also a highly lopsided system, with most of the active weather on the storm&a;rsquo;s east (right-hand) side. Rainbands were already pushing onto Florida&a;rsquo;s west coast by midday Saturday, and these will spread north and west on Saturday night into Sunday. The heaviest totals will likely end up just east of Cristobal&a;rsquo;s center, somewhere between New Orleans and Mobile, where 6&a;rdquo; &a;ndash; 10&a;rdquo; totals are predicted and isolated amounts could range higher.&l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn0\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;Satellite imagery on Saturday revealed the impact of widespread dry air to the west of Cristobal working its way into the system. Showers and thunderstorms (convection) wrapped around Cristobal&a;rsquo;s center in a patchy fashion (see image at top of post), allowing the low-level center to show up clearly on visible satellite. By far the strongest convection was located in a large band moving through the eastern Gulf well away from Cristobal&a;rsquo;s core.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;The large zone of strong south winds east of Cristobal was already pushing up tides across the Northeast Gulf. Storm surge observed atop the midday Saturday high tide ranged from 1 to 2 feet from Louisiana to the west coast of Florida. This prolonged high-water event will increase into Sunday. Because this is a weaker long-duration event, rather than a sudden, intense spike, the highest inundations can be expected in many areas during the Sunday high tide, perhaps extending into Sunday evening. Tides may remain elevated on Monday and perhaps even Tuesday, as southerly flow continues streaming onshore toward Cristobal (and eventually its remnants).&l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn1\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;In a &l;a href=\&q;https://hurricanehalsblog.wordpress.com/2020/06/06/life-saving-information-about-your-home-elevation-in-context-of-coastal-floods/\&q;&g;blog post on Saturday&l;/a&g;, storm surge expert Hal Needham explained the many variables that dictate how expected inundation levels can mesh with site-specific details. For example, he notes, local estimates of elevation relative to sea level are often averaged over 19-year tidal cycles, but if that average is decades old (e.g., 1983&a;ndash;2001), then it won&a;rsquo;t reflect sea level rise and/or local subsidence since then. In recent field work in coordination with Dauphin Island Sea Lab, Needham found that high tides on Dauphin Island are running about 21 inches above what one would expect from the Northern American Vertical Datum of 1988, abbreviated NAVD88. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&a;ldquo;We can think of this as though the water level already has a 21-inch head start on flooding the land before a storm even arrives,&a;rdquo; Needham said. &a;ldquo;And that doesn&a;rsquo;t even include the contribution to waves that can push additional water on top of the storm surge. These observations are important, and surprising, to many coastal homeowners, who assume the house level on their elevation certificate is the height above sea level. In many parts of the coast, high tide levels may be 1-3 feet higher than the NAVD88 datum, meaning the floor boards of people&a;rsquo;s homes are 1-3 feet closer to the water level than they thought.&a;rdquo;&l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn2\&q; /&g;&l;h2&g;&l;strong&g;Forecast for Cristobal&l;/strong&g;&l;/h2&g;&l;p&g;Cristobal&a;rsquo;s best shot at any strengthening will be Saturday night, when wind shear will remain on the light side (5-10 knots) and the storm will be passing over sea surface temperatures of 27-28&a;deg;C (81-82&a;deg;F). Convection is trying to wrap around Cristobal&a;rsquo;s center, but it may be too far a bridge for the storm to establish a strong inner core before it nears the coast. Cristobal&a;rsquo;s large size, its lopsided structure, and infiltrations of dry air should keep any intensification modest, and Cristobal is expected to arrive on the Gulf Coast as a strong tropical storm, most likely making landfall in southeast Louisiana. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;A few tornadoes will be possible on Sunday afternoon and evening as Cristobal pushes ashore, especially toward the north and east of Cristobal&a;rsquo;s center across southeast Louisiana and southern Mississippi, as flagged in &l;a href=\&q;https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day2otlk.html\&q;&g;Saturday&a;rsquo;s Day 2 outlook&l;/a&g; from the NOAA/NWS Storm Prediction Center.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Arriving on the heels of marginal Tropical Storm Bertha, which came ashore in South Carolina on May 27, Cristobal will give the United States its second named-storm landfall of the year&a;mdash;an impressive mark to achieve in early June!&l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn3\&q; /&g;&l;h2&g;&l;strong&g;Cristobal&a;rsquo;s future after landfall&l;/strong&g;&l;/h2&g;&l;p&g;As it moves inland, Cristobal will be pulled northward at an increasing clip by a strong midlatitude storm moving across the Rockies early next week. Rainfall will be fueled by an extremely moist atmosphere near and just east of Cristobal&a;rsquo;s center (see graphic above). A corridor of widespread 4&a;rdquo; &a;ndash; 6&a;rdquo; rains can be expected northwest across parts Louisiana, Mississippi, and Arkansas from Sunday night into Monday, with 2&a;rdquo; &a;ndash; 4&a;rdquo; possible further north into Missouri, Iowa, and/or Illinois from Monday into Tuesday. &l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn4\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;Given that Cristobal will be moving at a good clip, inland flood risk will be tempered, although some areas of heightened concern may be flagged if Cristobal&a;rsquo;s heaviest rains happen to coincide with areas of &l;a href=\&q;https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/Soilmst_Monitoring/US/Soilmst/Soilmst.shtml\&q;&g;high soil moisture&l;/a&g; from western Arkansas northward.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Cristobal could maintain its strength even as it zips up the Mississippi Valley toward the Great Lakes while losing its tropical characteristics along the way. Both the GFS and European operational models project Cristobal to be centered somewhere close to Iowa as a post-tropical cyclone by Tuesday, with a central pressure on par with that expected around landfall. Eventually Cristobal will merge with the approaching front and continue into Canada as a strong midlatitude storm.&l;/p&g;\n&q;,&q;wxnodes&q;:[{&q;id&q;:&q;wxn0&q;,&q;type&q;:&q;wxnode_internal_image&q;,&q;schema_version&q;:&q;1.2.0&q;,&q;links&q;:[],&q;align&q;:&q;none&q;,&q;assetid&q;:&q;b96fc0be-8af9-4fa1-a6a7-4d9625a78533&q;,&q;sizecode&q;:&q;large&q;,&q;credit&q;:&q;RAMMB/CIRA/CSU&q;,&q;linkurl&q;:&q;https://rammb-slider.cira.colostate.edu/&q;,&q;synopsis&q;:&q;Satellite image of mid-tropospheric water vapor at 1830Z (2:30 pm EDT) Saturday, June 6, 2020, showing the very dry air at mid-levels just west of Cristobal and weaker convection on the storm’s western half.
