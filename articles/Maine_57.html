After almost a year with the station, she decided to try her skills in front of the camera and crossed over into the reporting realm in September of 2022. \n\nKaddie is a North Carolina native. After living in various parts of NC; Charlotte, Asheville, the Triangle Area, just to name a few, she and her husband were ready for a new adventure. So, in May of 2021, they moved to Bangor. Kaddie got her Communication and Theatre degree from Appalachian State University and worked at the college's radio station while in school. While focusing in radio, she also did an internship at Clear Channel Radio in Charlotte, NC. After college, she worked in a few different fields from beer to software, and eventually made her way back to her first love of broadcasting. \n\nWhen she’s not reporting the news, she’s making jewelry, cooking with her husband, playing with her precious pugs, or watching horror movies.\n\nShe also has had the great opportunity to continue acting up here, in Maine. She keeps busy with various film and voiceover projects with local production groups.\n\nKaddie loves all the seasons in Maine, meeting the people, and seeing all that the beautiful state has to offer. She and her husband often say to each other, “I’m so glad we moved here.”","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"wabi","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","custom_gray_displaypriority":"12","last_updated_date":"2023-07-12T21:02:37.065Z"}}}]},"display_date":"2023-07-26T21:22:12.345Z","description":{"basic":"Thursday

While most kids were watching cartoons in the morning, Angela always loved watching \"Tim's Travels\" with Tim Ezell on FOX 2 News in St. Louis before she would go to school. Born and raised in St. Louis, MO, Angela started her broadcasting career as an intern at KSDK News Channel 5 St. Louis in 2016 prior to graduating with a B.S. in Mass Media in Multimedia Journalism from Northwest Missouri State University. While at Northwest, Angela covered the 2016 Iowa Caucus with her Political Journalism class where they were awarded the Academic Quality of Achievement Award for their coverage. Angela also was a Freelance Sports Reporter for KQ2 \"Football 2 Nite\" in St. Joseph, MO during her senior year. After graduation, Angela was a reporter/weather forecaster at KTVO in Kirksville, MO and then moved to Peoria, IL to be a Weekend Sports Anchor at Heart of Illinois ABC.  Finally, Angela achieved her lifelong dream of becoming a Morning News Anchor, here at WABI TV5 in Bangor, ME. \n\nOutside of news, Angela has been involved with the Miss America Organization for 6 years in Missouri, represented Missouri at the National Sweetheart Pageant in Hoopeston, IL in 2018, and has been a competitive dancer since the age of 4 as well as a professional dancer for the Kansas City Phantoms Football Team and has traveled to 41 out of 50 states. Being from the \"Show Me State\",  you can catch Angela cheering on the St. Louis Cardinals, St. Louis Blues, St. Louis Battlehawks and the Dallas Cowboys all the way from New England. Angela will be missing Imo's Pizza, Gooey Butter Cake, and \"T-ravs\" more than you can imagine so you can catch her around town trying many different eats or facetiming her husky Rosie.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2022-01-19T20:40:07.568Z","twitter":"angelalunatv","instagram":"angelaluna.tv","custom_gray_stationname":"wabi","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","custom_gray_displaypriority":"7"}}}]},"display_date":"2023-07-26T08:03:14.641Z","description":{"basic":"You
