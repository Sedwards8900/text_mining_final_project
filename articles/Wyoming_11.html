<p><b>1. INTRODUCTION</b>

<p>Though tornadoes are most commonly associated
with thunderstorms developing over the relatively flat 
regions of the central United States, research has shown
that tornadoes can occur in a variety of  terrain regimes,
including mountainous terrain. (e.g. Fujita 1989, Evans
and Johns 1995).  Evans and Johns (1995) found that
eighteen tornadoes were reported  in mountainous
regions of Wyoming over the forty-four-year period from
1950-1993 (Storm Data),  yielding an average
occurrence of  about once every other year.   Further,
such tornado development occurred during the summer
months of  June, July and August, and was found to  be
typically associated with  southwesterly flow aloft.

<p>It has also become evident over the past several
years that significant tornadoes (classified here has F2 or
greater events on the Fujita intensity scale) can occur in
very rugged mountainous terrain. Of the eighteen
mountain tornadoes in the Evans and Johns study, five
were rated as strong or violent in intensity (F2 or
greater).  All five strong or violent tornadoes took place
under a southwesterly flow regime and were associated
with more pronounced short wave troughs and stronger
wind fields than was the case with the weaker intensity
(F0-F1) tornado situations. 

<p>The Big Horn mountains in the north central part of
the state (Fig. 1) experienced the greatest number of
tornadoes of  any  Wyoming range during the forty-four-year period that Evans and Johns examined.  Seven tornadoes were reported in this range,  three of which
were rated as strong (F2 or F3) intensity.

<p>     This study focuses on the synoptic scale conditions
associated with the three strong tornadoes which occurred
in the Big Horns on three separate days:  June 26, 1959,
August 2, 1985, and July 21, 1993. (see Table 1.)  The
tornadoes occurred in the northwestern section of the Big
Horn mountains in extreme northeastern Big Horn
county.   All the tornadoes occurred within a twenty mile
diameter area and affected elevations above 8000 ft
M.S.L.

<p>The 1959 tornado was two hundred yards wide and
stayed on the ground for three miles as it moved north-northeast across Shell Canyon.  This tornado resulted in the only known fatality from a mountain tornado in the
western United States, and is one of only two tornadoes
known to have caused a fatality in Wyoming.  The other
occurred in Cheyenne in 1979.  (see Parker and Hickey
1980.)   The 1993 Big Horn tornado was on the ground
for almost eight miles and reached a half-mile in width as
it moved across Dayton Gulch. Though the 1985 tornado
was the smallest of the three events discussed here, it was
rated the strongest according to Storm Data and blew
down over 600 acres of harvestable timber in roughly the
same area as the 1993 tornado.

<p>     A possible fourth event occurred during the summer
of 1978 or 1979 about seven miles east of the 1959
tornado, according to the Big Horn National Forest
Service.   This event had a damage path 5 miles long and
half a mile wide.  Since the exact date of this event is
unknown, it was not included in this study.

<p><b>2. GEOGRAPHY/TERRAIN</b>

<p>     The Big Horn mountain range extends along a
southeast to northwest orientation across north central
Wyoming and extreme southern Montana, and is located
about 150 miles east of the Continental Divide.  (see Fig.
1.) Elevations vary from 6000 ft M.S.L. to just over
13000 ft M.S.L.  Cloud Peak, the highest elevation in the
Big Horns at 13175 ft M.S.L., is located near the center
of the range, southwest of Sheridan, Wyoming, and is
generally regarded as the dividing point between the
"northern" and "southern" Big Horns.

<p>     The Big Horn mountains are surrounded by some of
the lowest terrain in the region as elevations fall under
4000 ft M.S.L. across extreme northeast Wyoming, with
elevations under 3000 ft M.S.L. in eastern Montana.  The
Big Horn basin lies immediately to the west of the Big
Horn mountains and separates them from the Absaroka
range in northwestern Wyoming.  Elevations in the Big
Horn basin generally range from 4000 ft to 5000 ft
M.S.L. While the Big Horn and Absaroka mountains
define the eastern and western borders of the Big Horn
basin, the Owl Creek mountains, a small range of
mountains with elevations ranging between 7000 ft and
8000 ft M.S.L., lie along the southern periphery of the
basin.  There is no major geographical barrier to the
north of the Big Horn basin.

<p>     The proximity of lower terrain and location well east
of the continental divide make the Big Horns more  likely
to experience deeper moisture from the Gulf of Mexico
than mountains further to the west and southwest.

<p><b>3. SYNOPTIC SCALE FEATURES</b>

<p>     Evans and Johns found that southwesterly flow at the
mid and upper levels of the troposphere was associated
with all five of the F2 or greater tornado events in
Wyoming, including the three events discussed here (Fig.
2).  In each case a strong shortwave trough was located
upstream from Wyoming at 1200 UTC on the day of
tornado occurrence, which moved eastward into  western
Wyoming  or eastern Idaho during the afternoon.    

<center>
<p><img align=middle src="jerjf2.gif">
<p>Figure 2.  500 mb composite for the five F2 or greater mountain tornado events in Wyoming at 1200 UTC on the day of occurrence (After Evans and Johns 1995).
</center>

<p>     On two of the three days in which a significant
tornado  occurred in the Big Horns (1959 and 1993), the
upper system affecting Wyoming was an open trough. 
With the other occurrence (1985), the upper system
started out as a closed low over eastern Oregon during
the morning, which moved eastward as an open trough
that afternoon.  In all three cases, the location of the
trough placed Wyoming under a jet axis at the upper
levels of the troposphere with 250 MB wind speeds at or
above 25 m/s ( 50 kt). (not shown).  A 250 MB speed
maximum of greater than 30 m/s (60 kt) was embedded
in the jet  and moved over southern and central Wyoming
during the afternoon, placing the north central part of the
state under  diffluent flow aloft associated with the  left
exit region of the jet maximum.

<p>     The composite chart at 500 MB for the five
significant mountain  tornado events in Wyoming, using 
upper air data from 1200 UTC  prior to the event (Fig.
2), shows a well defined and negatively tilted trough
extending from the Pacific Northwest into the lower
Colorado valley.  Since the 500 MB charts for the
individual events are similar to one another, this 
composite is very representative of the flow aloft over
Wyoming on the days in which a significant tornado
occurred in the Big Horns. In each of the strong Big Horn tornado cases, mid-tropospheric temperatures were rather cold for mid to
late summer.  Temperatures were between -10 deg C  and 
-12o C at Lander, WY at 1200 UTC in all three cases,
while temperatures at  or below -15 deg C were present over
the northern intermountain region of Idaho and Nevada. 
Mid troposhperic (500 MB) temperatures cooled on
average about 1 to 2 deg C over Lander, WY
from 1200 UTC to 0000 UTC on the day of occurrence. 
This suggests mid level cold air advection played only a
minor role in airmass destabilization in these three cases,
which is similar to findings by Evenson and Johns (1995)
regarding severe thunderstorms in the northwestern U.S.

<p>     At the surface, a low developed over west central or
central Wyoming in two cases, 1985 and 1993, along an
intersection between a north to south oriented cold front
and a quasi stationary front or convergence boundary
which extended eastward across northern Wyoming. The
low then moved east across north central or central
Wyoming during the afternoon, and was located very
near or to the east of the northern Big Horns near the time
of tornado occurrence. (see Figs. 3 and 4).  In the 1959
case, the surface low developed over south central
Wyoming and tracked northeastward into northeastern
Wyoming during the afternoon. (see Fig. 5).  On all three
days, a cold front extended southward from the low with
a cold or occluded front extending northward across
central or eastern Montana.

<p>     The location and movement of the surface low is
significant since this allowed north or northeasterly  low
level winds to develop on all three days across north
central Wyoming and eastern Montana. This enabled  low
level moisture to advect southwestward out of eastern
Montana and into north central Wyoming. As mentioned
previously, geographical barriers border the Big Horn
basin on all sides but to the north, which makes the most
effective direction for advection of  low level moisture
into the basin to be from the north or northeast out of 
southeastern Montana.

<p><b>4. THUNDERSTORM EVOLUTION</b>

<p>     Examination of satellite imagery from the 1985 and
1993 events (not shown), and operational experience by
the lead author, indicate that initial development of the
thunderstorms responsible for the Big Horn tornadoes
occurred well west of the Big Horns in these cases, and 
appeared to have been associated with larger scale
forcing associated with  the  upper level system.  Surface
observations and satellite data suggest these storms were
initially high based, but became lower based and
intensified as they encountered higher values of low level
moisture in the Big Horn basin.  No satellite images were
available for the 1959 Shell Canyon tornado, however the
surface observations suggest that a convective evolution
similar to the other two cases was possible.
<hr>
<p><b>5. CASE STUDY</b>

<p>   On 21 July 1993, a large tornado developed over the
northern Big Horn mountains northeast of Greybull, WY. 
(See "T" on Fig. 4). The tornado formed near Little Bald
Mountain (elevation 9907 ft M.S.L.), just north of
Wyoming Highway 14-alternate, and moved north and
then northeastward destroying over 1500 acres of
harvestable timber before lifting nearly eight miles later. 
Maximum width of the damage path was approximately
one-half mile.
<p>     Though this event was initially interpreted as
damage from "straight line" thunderstorm winds, detailed
analysis of aerial photographs of the damage, taken by
the U. S. Forest Service the day after the event, revealed
that the event was a tornado. In addition, a man leading a
hiking exhibition just south of Highway 14-alternate 
described seeing "a large, black, rotating funnel cloud"
extending downward from the thunderstorm base as it
moved out of the Big Horn basin, shortly  before it
disappeared behind Little Bald Mountain.
<p>     The middle and upper tropospheric pattern over the
western United States at 1200 UTC on the day of
occurrence was very similar to the composite shown in
Fig. 2.  The 500 MB analysis (Fig. 6), indicated  a
negatively tilted trough over the Great Basin, which
moved eastward to the western Wyoming border during
the afternoon.  Winds at 500 MB were greater than 30 kt
(15 m/s) over the northern intermountain region and the
northern Rockies. At 250 MB (not shown), northern
Wyoming remained under the left exit region of an upper
jet streak with winds at or above 60 kt (30 m/s) across
the central part of the state.

<p><img align=middle src="jerjf6.gif">
<p>Figure 6.  500 mb analysis for 1200 UTC on 21 July 1993.
</center>


<p>     Surface cyclogenesis occurred over central
Wyoming  at the intersection of a north-south oriented
cold front and a developing warm front during the late
afternoon. This low deepened and moved northeastward
over north central Wyoming with a 1000 MB low center
located just southeast of  Sheridan, WY at 0000 UTC
(Fig. 4).  Increasing south to southeasterly surface winds
developed over the High Plains region  as a result of
pressure falls over the northern Rockies. These winds
carried moisture from the Gulf of Mexico northward. 
The moisture was then advected northwestward,
following the lower terrain, across the western Dakotas
and into eastern Montana.  As low level winds became
more northerly over northern Wyoming during the
afternoon, this  moisture was advected  southwestward
into north central Wyoming.  
<p>     A sounding for the Big Horn basin near the time of
occurrence was constructed by modifying the 0000 UTC
22 July sounding from Lander, WY. This sounding was
modified by SHARP (SkewT-Hodograph Analysis and
Research Program) version 95 (Hart 1995) using the
surface temperature, dew point, wind direction, and wind
speed at Worland, which is in the Big Horn basin.  (See
Fig. 7). The modified sounding suggests the airmass was 
strongly unstable with surface based lifted indices of -10
and CAPEs near 3500 j/kg. Northerly  surface winds in
the Basin strongly  veered to southwesterly above the
boundary layer, used as approximately 2500m MSL here.
This resulted in 0-3 km AGL  storm relative helicities of
200 m2/s2 using a storm motion of  235 degrees at 25 kt,
which is 30 degrees to the right and 70 percent of the
mean wind.

<p>     Though strong to severe thunderstorms did develop
along the lee trough/dry line which extended from
northeastern Wyoming to eastern Colorado during the
late afternoon, the thunderstorm responsible for
producing the tornado discussed here developed well
west of the low level moisture axis in stronger synoptic
scale forcing associated with a shortwave trough. The
storm intensified rapidly as deeper low level moisture
and increased storm relative inflow were encountered in
the Big Horn basin.  One-half inch diameter hail was
reported from Greybull, WY at approximately 2330
GMT as the storm moved through the area.  Shortly after
this, the hiker reported seeing the "large funnel cloud"
protruding from the storm as it moved into the northern
Big Horns and subsequently produced the large tornado. 
Further east, hail was reported from the storm at Burgess
Junction which is just over 10 miles east of the large
tornado event.  The storm continued to be intense as it
moved from the Big Horn mountains into the deeper
moisture across southeastern Montana.  Several more
reports of large hail and damaging winds were received
from this storm as it move across sparsely populated
eastern Montana through the evening. However, there
were no more reports of tornadoes.

<hr>

<p><b>6. CONCLUSION</b>

<p>     Three strong (F2-F3) tornadoes have been reported
within a twenty  mile diameter area in the northern Big
Horn mountains since 1950.  These events occurred
during the summer months of June, July or August and 
were associated with very  similar synoptic scale features. 
All events occurred under southwesterly flow at the
middle and upper levels of the troposphere under the left
exit region of an upper level jet maximum. Middle and
upper level wind speeds were relatively strong for
summer. At the surface, a low developed over central
Wyoming  and traveled east to northeastward during the
afternoon of tornado occurrence.
<p>     The combination of surface low location and
topography appears to have played a major role in the
availability of low level moisture and wind shear on all
three cases.  Topography limits low level moisture
advection into the Big Horn basin  from all directions but
the north. Therefore, the most efficient means of
advecting low level moisture into the basin is by having
northerly low level winds  across  southern Montana and
north central Wyoming. Such low level flow is common
when a surface low moves south or east of this region,
which occurred in all three tornado cases. The
thunderstorms which produced the tornadoes appeared 
to have developed well west of the Big Horns in a region
of strong synoptic scale forcing.  These storms intensified
quickly once they interacted with deeper low level
moisture in the Big Horn basin and Big Horn mountain
region.
<p>     Storm intensification over north central Wyoming
also appeared to have been aided by  the increased wind
shear created by  the northerly  surface winds over the
Big Horn basin.  These winds produced strong low level
inflow and relatively high values of storm relative helicity 
as winds above the boundary layer veered strongly to
southwesterly.
<p>     This study shows that a specific type of pattern is
associated with strong tornado development in the Big
Horn mountains.  When forecasters  observe such a 
pattern developing, they need to monitor high based
storms moving toward the Big Horn Basin from the
southwest and should anticipate possible intensification
and supercell development.
